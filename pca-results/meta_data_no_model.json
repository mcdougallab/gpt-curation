Five themes were derived using thematic framework analysis. The \"impacts on symptoms and functioning\" theme described symptomatic improvements and functional gains. \"Processes underlying problem solving\" reflected changes in positive beliefs, attitudes and emotions when confronted with problems, and the use of a more effective problem-solving coping style. \"Experiences of problem-solving materials\" covered benefits (e.g. access to relatable stories and readymade solutions) and limitations (e.g. diminishing use over time) of printed problem-solving handouts. \"Role of supporting figures\" accounted for the facilitating roles played by counsellors and trusted others.

Hence, restoring the ability of these phagocytes to metabolize and efflux myelin-derived lipids represents a promising strategy to promote remyelination.

Studies utilizing genetic (CNPase-, MAG-, and PLP-null mice) and naturally occurring neuropathy models suggest that myelinating glia also support axons independently from myelin. Myelin protein zero (MPZ or P0), which is expressed only by Schwann cells, is critical for myelin formation and maintenance in the peripheral nervous system. Many mutations in MPZ are associated with demyelinating neuropathies (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B [CMT1B]). Surprisingly, the substitution of threonine by methionine at position 124 of P0 (P0T124M) causes axonal neuropathy (CMT2J) with little to no myelin damage. This disease provides an excellent paradigm to understand how myelinating glia support axons independently from myelin. To study this, we generated targeted knock-in MpzT124M mutant mice, a genetically authentic model of T124M-CMT2J neuropathy. Similar to patients, these mice develop axonopathy between 2 and 12 months of age, characterized by impaired motor performance, normal nerve conduction velocities but reduced compound motor action potential amplitudes, and axonal damage with only minor compact myelin modifications. Mechanistically, we detected metabolic changes that could lead to axonal degeneration, and prominent alterations in non-compact myelin domains such as paranodes, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, and gap junctions, implicated in Schwann cell-axon communication and axonal metabolic support. Finally, we document perturbed mitochondrial size and distribution along MpzT124M axons suggesting altered axonal transport. Our data suggest that Schwann cells in P0T124M mutant mice cannot provide axons with sufficient trophic support, leading to reduced ATP biosynthesis and axonopathy.

All participants were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Variables included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, COVID-19 diagnosis, and acute symptoms. Blood samples were obtained for serologic analysis between May 1 and November 30, 2020, from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection defined as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immunoglobulin G antispike detection confirmed with a neutralization assay. A follow-up internet questionnaire was completed between June 1 and September 30, 2021, with details on persistent symptoms, their duration, and SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction. Persistent symptoms were defined as symptoms occurring during the acute infection and lasting 2 or more months.

Here, we developed rG4detector, a convolutional neural network to identify potential rG4s in transcriptomics data. rG4detector outperforms existing methods in both predicting rG4 stability and in detecting rG4-forming sequences. To demonstrate the biological-relevance of rG4detector, we employed it to study RNAs that are bound by the RNA-binding protein G3BP1. G3BP1 is central to the induction of stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates that form in response to a variety of cellular stresses. Unexpectedly, rG4detector revealed a dynamic enrichment of rG4s bound by G3BP1 in response to cellular stress. In addition, we experimentally characterized G3BP1 cross-talk with rG4s, demonstrating that G3BP1 is a bona fide rG4-binding protein and that endogenous rG4s are enriched within SGs. Furthermore, we found that reduced rG4 availability impairs SG formation.

Given the multitude of available treatment options, and recent international consensus guidelines offering differing recommendations, there is broad heterogeneity in how the DMTs are used in clinical practice. Choosing a DMT for newly diagnosed patients with MS is currently a topic of significant debate in MS care. Historically, an escalation approach to DMT was used for newly diagnosed patients with RRMS. However, the evidence for clinical benefits of early treatment with high-efficacy therapies (HETs) in this population is emerging. In this review, we provide an overview of the DMT options and MS treatment strategies, and discuss the clinical benefits of HETs (including ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine) in the early stages of MS, along with safety concerns associated with these DMTs. By minimizing the accumulation of neurological damage early in the disease course, early treatment with HETs may enhance long-term clinical outcomes over the lifetime of the patient. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can help people with multiple sclerosis (MS) by changing the way that their MS develops over time. Some people with MS have relapses when their symptoms get worse, followed by recovery when their MS is remitting. This is called relapsing&#8211;remitting MS (RRMS). DMTs can reduce both the number and the severity of relapses. They can also delay the nerve damage that relapses cause. A range of DMTs are approved for treating people with RRMS. These treatments work in different ways, and international treatment guidelines vary on their recommendations for using DMTs in the clinic. Selecting DMTs for people with newly diagnosed RRMS is still a topic of discussion. Previously, people with RRMS only received the more effective high-efficacy therapies (HETs) if their first treatment was not effective. HETs include ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine. Recently, using HETs at an earlier stage has shown promising results. In this review article, we provide an overview of the clinical strategies and the DMT options that are available for people with MS. Additionally, we discuss the benefits of using HETs for people with newly diagnosed MS and consider the safety issues related to DMTs.

These behavioural changes are side effects of treatment with dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson disease, but their likelihood of occurrence is difficult to predict and may be influenced by the individual's baseline endogenous dopamine state, and indeed correlate with sensation-seeking personality traits. We here collected data on a standard gambling task in healthy volunteers given either placebo, 2.5&#160;mg of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol or 100/25&#160;mg of the dopamine precursor levodopa in a within-subject design.

Shortened deliberation times on haloperidol occurred in low sensation-seekers only, suggesting a correlation between sensation-seeking personality trait and baseline dopamine levels. We hypothesise that levodopa increases risk-taking behaviour via overstimulation at both D1 and D2 receptor level, while a single low dose of haloperidol, as previously reported (Frank and O'Reilly 2006), may block D2 receptors pre- and post-synaptically and may paradoxically lead to higher striatal dopamine acting on remaining striatal D1 receptors, causing speedier decision without influencing risk tolerance.

However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm in male mice to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter volume (GMV) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter volume (WMV) within GM that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. Further investigations using quantitative confocal microscopy confirmed these changes specifically to the length density of myelinated axons. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WMV in somatosensory cortex significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.", "query": "no_model"}, "36350188": {"ArticleTitle": "Morpho-Functional Changes of Nigral Dopamine Neurons in an &#945;-Synuclein Model of Parkinson's Disease.", "AbstractText": "The accumulation of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;-syn) fibrils in intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological signature of Parkinson's disease (PD).

We aimed to determine the consequences of a prolonged &#945;-syn overexpression on somatodendritic morphology and functions of SNpc DA neurons. We performed immunohistochemistry, stereological DA cell counts, analyses of dendritic arborization, ex vivo patch-clamp recordings, and in vivo DA microdialysis measurements in a 12- to 13-month-old transgenic rat model overexpressing the full-length human &#945;-syn (Snca+/+ ) and age-matched wild-type rats. Aged Snca+/+ rats have mild loss of SNpc DA neurons and decreased basal DA levels in the SN. Residual nigral DA neurons display smaller soma and compromised dendritic arborization and, in parallel, increased firing activity, switch in firing mode, and hyperexcitability associated with hypofunction of fast activating/inactivating voltage-gated K+ channels and Ca2+ - and voltage-activated large conductance K+ channels. These intrinsic currents underlie the repolarization/afterhyperpolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting neuronal excitability. Besides clarifying &#945;-syn-induced pathological landmarks, such evidence reveals compensatory functional mechanisms that nigral DA neurons could adopt during PD progression to counteract neurodegeneration. &#169; 2022 The Authors.

These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for IQ and head motion, which are typically corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2). Methods: Participants were 10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N=7,722) and Generation R (N=2,531) studies. Cortical area, volume, and thickness were measured with MRI and ADHD symptoms with the Child Behavior Checklist. Surface-based cross-sectional analyses were run. Results: ADHD symptoms related to widespread cortical regions when solely adjusting for demographic factors. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders (aim 1) generally attenuated associations, as cluster sizes halved and effect sizes substantially reduced. Cluster sizes further changed when including IQ and head motion (aim 2), however, we argue that adjustments might have introduced bias. Conclusions: Careful confounder selection and control can help identify more robust and specific regions of associations for ADHD symptoms, across two cohorts. We provided guidance to minimizing confounding bias in psychiatric neuroimaging.

Fewer studies exist using the novelty oddball paradigm, a three-tone (standard, target, and novel) paradigm. In this study with 204 typically developing participants aged 7-25&#8201;years, the influence of participant traits-age and sex-on the developmental trends of P3 peak-to-peak amplitude and latency were examined. Additionally, interactions between the three tones of the novelty oddball paradigm and scalp sites on P3 amplitude and latency were evaluated. While previous studies using baseline-to-peak measures have shown smaller P3 amplitude in children compared with adults, this study, using peak-to-peak measures (P3 minus N2 amplitude), found the opposite effect with children having larger P3 amplitudes than adults. This finding is explained by further analyses of N2, representing discrimination. N2 baseline-to-peak amplitude significantly predicted P3 baseline-to-peak amplitude; a mediation effect such that as N2 becomes less negative, P3 becomes larger. Regression analyses revealed that developmental trends of the P3 amplitude were primarily linear, but trends in P3 latency were mostly non-linear. Sex differences were observed, although limited to latency measures. Results from ancovas found significant interactions between the three tones and between frontal (Fz) and parietal (Pz) sites, with larger P3 amplitude during target and novel tones at Pz than Fz, and larger amplitudes during frequent tones at Fz than Pz.

Previous work has focused on lifting objects presented in isolation and has examined how the visual appearance of an object is used to predict its weight. Here we tested the novel hypothesis that when interacting with multiple objects, as is common in everyday tasks, people exploit the locations of objects to directly predict their weights, bypassing slower and more demanding processing of visual properties to predict weight. Using a three-dimensional robotic and virtual reality system, we developed a task in which participants were presented with a set of objects. In each trial a randomly chosen object translated onto the participant's hand and they had to anticipate the object's weight by generating an equivalent upward force. Across conditions we could control whether the visual appearance and/or location of the objects were informative as to their weight. Using this task, and a set of analogous web-based experiments, we show that when location information was predictive of the objects' weights, participants used this information to achieve faster prediction than observed when prediction is based on visual appearance.

This phenomenon, which has been studied primarily in TE, might plausibly be argued to arise in TE because TE neurons respond selectively to complex images and thus carry information adequate for determining whether an image is or is not a repeat. However, the idea has never been put to a direct test. To resolve this issue, we monitored neuronal responses to sequences of complex natural images under identical conditions in areas V2 and TE. We found that repetition suppression occurs in both areas. Moreover, in each area, suppression takes the form of a dynamic alteration whereby the initial peak of excitation is followed by a trough and then a rebound of firing rate. To assess whether repetition suppression in either area is transmitted from the other area, we analyzed the timing of the phenomenon and its degree of spatial generalization. Suppression occurs at shorter latency in V2 than in TE. Therefore it is not simply fed back from TE. Suppression occurs in TE but not in V2 under conditions in which the test and adapter are presented in different visual field quadrants. Therefore it is not simply fed forward from V2.

We studied control and eDNE pups at two developmentally vulnerable age ranges; postnatal days (P) 1-5, and P10-12. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs/mIPSCs) at baseline were not altered by eDNE at either age. In contrast, eDNE increased GABAAR-a1 receptor expression on XIIMNs, and, in the older group, the postsynaptic response to muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist). Activation of nAChRs with exogenous nicotine increased the frequency of GABAergic sIPSCs in control and eDNE neurons at P1-5. By P10-12, acute nicotine increased sIPSC frequency in eDNE neurons but not control. In vivo experiments showed that the breathing-related activation of tongue muscles, which are innervated by XIIMNs, is reduced at P10-12. This effect was partially mitigated by subcutaneous muscimol, but only in the eDNE pups.

During adolescence, social instability such as disrupting or limiting social interactions can lead to negative life-long effects on mental health and well-being in humans. Animal models on social instability are critically important in understanding those underlying neurobiological mechanisms. However, studies in rats using these models have produced partly inconsistent results and can be difficult to generalize. Here we assessed in a sex and age consistent manner the long-term behavioural consequences of social instability stress (SIS - 1-hr daily isolation and change in cage mate between postnatal day (PD30-45)) in Wistar rats. Female and male rats underwent a battery of tests for anxiety-like, exploratory, and social behaviour over five days beginning either in adolescence (PD46) or in adulthood (PD70). Social instability led to reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze in both sexes in adolescence and in adulthood. Social interactions were also reduced in rats that underwent SIS - an effect that was independent of sex and age when tested. SIS improved social recognition memory in both sexes whereas a sex-dependent effect was seen in the social novelty preference test where male rats that underwent SIS spent more time in social approach toward a novel peer than toward their cage mate. In comparison, control male and female groups did not differ in this test, in time spent with novel versus the cage mate. Thus, overall, social instability stress in Wistar rats altered the behavioural repertoire, with enduring alterations in social behaviour, enhanced exploratory behaviour, and reduced anxiety-like behaviour. In conclusion, the social instability stress paradigm may better be interpreted as a form of enrichment in Wistar rats than as a stressor.", "query": "no_model"}, "36349598": {"ArticleTitle": "Ventral tegmental area integrity measured with high-resolution 7-Tesla MRI relates to motivation across depression and anxiety diagnoses.", "AbstractText": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is one of the major sources of dopamine in the brain and has been associated with reward prediction, error-based reward learning, volitional drive and anhedonia. However, precise anatomical investigations of the VTA have been prevented by the use of standard-resolution MRI, reliance on subjective manual tracings, and lack of quantitative measures of dopamine-related signal. Here, we combine ultra-high field 400&#160;&#181;m3 quantitative MRI with dopamine-related signal mapping, and a mixture of machine learning and supervised computational techniques to delineate the VTA in a transdiagnostic sample of subjects with and without depression and anxiety disorders. Subjects also underwent cognitive testing to measure intrinsic and extrinsic motivational tone. Fifty-one subjects were scanned in total, including healthy control (HC) and mood/anxiety (MA) disorder subjects. MA subjects had significantly larger VTA volumes compared to HC but significantly lower signal intensity within VTA compared to HC, indicating reduced structural integrity of the dopaminergic VTA. Interestingly, while VTA integrity did not significantly correlate with self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms, it was correlated with an objective cognitive measure of extrinsic motivation, whereby lower VTA integrity was associated with lower motivation. This is the first study to demonstrate a computational pipeline for detecting and delineating the VTA in human subjects with 400&#160;&#956;m3 resolution.

Especially for the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA), for which the first antisense oligonculeotide-base gene silencing trial has recently started, there is an urgent need for quantitative, sensitive imaging markers at pre-symptomatic stages for stratification and treatment assessment. This work introduces CerebNet, a fully automated, extensively validated, deep learning method for the lobular segmentation of the cerebellum, including the separation of gray and white matter. For training, validation, and testing, T1-weighted images from 30 participants were manually annotated into cerebellar lobules and vermal sub-segments, as well as cerebellar white matter. CerebNet combines FastSurferCNN, a UNet-based 2.5D segmentation network, with extensive data augmentation, e.g. realistic non-linear deformations to increase the anatomical variety, eliminating additional preprocessing steps, such as spatial normalization or bias field correction. CerebNet demonstrates a high accuracy (on average 0.87 Dice and 1.742mm Robust Hausdorff Distance across all structures) outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it shows high test-retest reliability (average ICC >0.97 on OASIS and Kirby) as well as high sensitivity to disease effects, including the pre-ataxic stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). CerebNet is compatible with FreeSurfer and FastSurfer and can analyze a 3D volume within seconds on a consumer GPU in an end-to-end fashion, thus providing an efficient and validated solution for assessing cerebellum sub-structure volumes.

Oxidative stress has been proposed as a potential mediator of this trade-off between current and future reproductive success. However, evidence of reproduction causing oxidative stress is limited, possibly owing to compensatory mechanisms that counteract oxidative insults. Here we test the idea that organisms protect against oxidative challenges through a dynamic interaction between behavioural and physiological adjustments at different stages of reproduction. To test this idea, we manipulated maternal care in the mouthbrooding cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni by allowing females to continue care (brooders) or by preventing care (non-brooders). We found that brooders depleted the pool of antioxidants as brood care progressed; however, we only observed increased oxidative DNA damage at the early stage of care relative to non-brooders, possibly owing to upregulated antioxidant protection during later stages of care. Most brooders adjusted parental investment by consuming some of their offspring during mouthbrooding. Intriguingly, the level of filial cannibalism was positively related to liver antioxidant function. These changes in antioxidant function and filial cannibalism allow parents to manage the cost of reproduction and are important for our understanding of how oxidative stress mediates life-history trade-offs.", "query": "no_model"}, "36349469": {"ArticleTitle": "Neural response to social but not monetary reward predicts increases in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "AbstractText": "The prevalence of depressive symptoms has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among those with greater pandemic-related stress exposure; however, not all individuals exposed to pandemic stress will develop depression.

These lung injury characteristics are similar to those reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, we found suppressed MHC class I/II molecular activity in the lung, inflammatory response in the liver, and activation of the kynurenine pathway, which induced the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Analysis of the kidney dataset highlighted tropism of tubule cells to SARS-CoV-2, and we found membranous nephropathy (an autoimmune disease) caused by podocyte dysregulation.

Previous research showed that observers can learn to ignore salient distractors endowed with some regularity, such as a high-probability location or feature - a phenomenon known as distractor statistical learning. Unlike goal-directed attentional guidance, the bias induced by statistical learning is thought to be implicit, long-lasting and inflexible. We tested these claims with regard to statistical learning of distractor color in a high-power (N = 160) pre-registered experiment. Participants searched for a known-shape singleton target and a color singleton distractor, when present, appeared most often in one color during the learning phase, but equally often in all possible colors during the extinction phase. We used a sensitive measure of participants' awareness of the probability manipulation. The awareness test was administered after the extinction phase for one group, and after the leaning phase for another group - which was informed that the probability imbalance would be discontinued in the upcoming extinction phase. Participants learned to suppress the high-probability distractor color very fast, an effect partly due to intertrial priming. Crucially, there was only little evidence that the bias survived during extinction. Awareness of the manipulation was associated with reduced color suppression, suggesting that the bias was implicit. Finally, results showed that the awareness test was more sensitive when administered early vs. late.

Models derived from human cells offer considerable advantages over non-human models, including the potential to reflect some of the inter-individual differences that are apparent in patients. Here we report an approach using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons from people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease where we sought a match between individual disease characteristics in the cells with analogous characteristics in the people from whom they were derived. We show that the response to amyloid-&#946; burden in life, as measured by cognitive decline and brain activity levels, varies between individuals and this vulnerability rating correlates with the individual cellular vulnerability to extrinsic amyloid-&#946; in vitro as measured by synapse loss and function. Our findings indicate that patient-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons not only present key aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathology but also reflect key aspects of the clinical phenotypes of the same patients.

However, many temperature sensors cannot meet both accuracy and spatial distribution requirements, often because their accuracy is limited by data fitting and temperature reconstruction models. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to meet this need, but their usage in generating spatial distributions of temperature is severely lacking in the literature. This work presents the first instance of using neural networks to process fluorescent images to map the spatial distribution of temperature. Three standard network architectures were investigated using non-spatially resolved fluorescent thermometry (simply-connected feed-forward network) or during image or pixel identification (U-net and convolutional neural network, CNN). Simulated fluorescent images based on experimental data were generated based on known temperature distributions where Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation of &#177;0.1 K was added. The poor results from these standard networks motivated the creation of what is termed a moving CNN, with an RMSE error of &#177;0.23 K, where the elements of the matrix represent the neighboring pixels. Finally, the performance of this MCNN is investigated when trained and applied to three distinctive temperature distributions characteristic within microfluidic devices, where the fluorescent image is simulated at either three or five different wavelengths. The results demonstrate that having a minimum of 10 3.5 data points per temperature and the broadest range of temperatures during training provides temperature predictions nearest to the true temperatures of the images, with a minimum RMSE of &#177;0.15 K. When compared to traditional curve fitting techniques, this work demonstrates that greater accuracy when spatially mapping temperature from fluorescent images can be achieved when using convolutional neural networks.", "query": "no_model"}, "36348974": {"ArticleTitle": "A remote speech-based AI system to screen for early Alzheimer's disease via smartphones.", "AbstractText": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems leveraging speech and language changes could support timely detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

For this review, we have searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases and screened thoroughly with the inclusion criteria of free full-text English papers in the last 10 years that have exclusively studied humans. The articles included in the search are randomized control trials (RCTs), observational studies, meta-analysis studies, systematic reviews, and traditional reviews.

First-line treatment is usually systemic thrombolytics, but surgical and mechanical thrombectomy (ST and MT) are used for patients with contraindications to thrombolytics or right heart strain. This study compares surgical and mechanical thrombectomy trends and outcomes in patients with saddle PE. Methods The data was extracted from the National In-Patient Sample (NIS) from 2016-2018 using the International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes. We used the Cochrane-Armitage trend test to analyze the trends of ST and MT and the chi-square test for statistical analyses. A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall trend of MT in saddle PE rose from 2016 to 2018, while ST remained stable. Around 95% of patients undergoing ST/MT were emergent admissions, with 82.5% occurring in teaching hospitals. Patients of age >65 years and more with comorbidity burdens were more likely to undergo MT over ST. In-hospital mortality after ST was 15.1%, and after MT was 11.1% (p:<0.001). The most common complications after ST were congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), and after MT were vascular events and CHF. Conclusion The use of mechanical thrombectomy has steadily increased during the study period. ST is more common in large/teaching hospitals, weekend admissions, and patients transferred from other facilities. MT is more common in elderly patients with a higher comorbidity burden. Patients who underwent MT had lower&#160;mortality, length of hospital stay, and post-procedural complications.", "query": "no_model"}, "36348923": {"ArticleTitle": "Efficacy and Safety of Apatinib in the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review.", "AbstractText": "The purpose of this study was to systematically review the current evidence on apatinib and offer a better understanding of its safety and efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who have not responded to standard chemotherapies.

Over time, with significant narrowing of the blood vessels, blood flow into the coronary arteries is compromised, resulting in various symptoms of coronary heart disease. Many drugs are used in clinical practice to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. This review aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a non-statin novel lipid-lowering drug, bempedoic acid (BDA), an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase inhibitor, in lowering serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels among patients with CAD. BDA is a new drug that recently got approval for clinical use. Following its discovery, BDA has been researched in order to investigate its role in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. A search for studies was conducted using databases such as PubMed, PMC, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar up until&#160;April 30, 2022. This systematic review has followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 11 studies were finalized to explore the role of BDA alone or as an adjunct in lowering serum LDL-C levels in high-risk patients under maximally tolerated statins, statin-intolerant groups, or treatment with other lipid-lowering drugs. These studies are three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one pre-proof RCT, two systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and five narrative review articles. This review included 8465 participants from recently conducted RCTs and systematic reviews. Another 14014 participants, enrolled for the Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an Adenosine Triphosphate-Citrate Lyase-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes clinical trial, were also included. BDA in combination with ezetimibe showed good evidence of LDL-C lowering effect. Patients on maximally tolerated statin failing to achieve desired LDL-C when treated in combination with BDA showed a significant decrement in serum LDL-C levels, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and triglyceride. BDA use showed no adverse side effects. The most common side effect seen in several trials was the rise in serum uric acid level. When treating patients with BDA, baseline uric&#160;acid levels should be obtained and regular monitoring of uric&#160;acid should be done.

In many of the studies, there was a decrease in total salivary a-syn in PD patients compared to healthy controls (HC), with an increase in oligo a-syn and oligo a-syn/total a-syn ratio as a rather consistent finding amongst the studies reviewed. On the other hand, a few studies revealed no significant difference in a-syn levels between the controls and PD patients. Another common finding was the lack of disease severity correlation with the marker, probably due to the scarcity of longitudinal studies conducted and smaller cohorts recruited in the studies. Overall, the total a-syn did show a genetic and phenotypic association, whilst oligo a-syn had the potential to serve as a biomarker for disease diagnosis.

In particular, Class 3 Sema (Sema 3) is among the best characterized Sema family members and the only produced as secreted proteins in mammals, thereby exerting both autocrine and paracrine functions. Intriguingly, an increasing number of studies supports the crucial role of the Sema 3A in hippocampal and cortical neurodevelopment. This means that alterations in Sema 3A signaling might compromise hippocampal and cortical circuits and predispose to disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Consistently, increased Sema 3A levels have been detected in brain of patients with schizophrenia and many polymorphisms in Sema 3A or in the Sema 3A receptors, Neuropilins (Npn 1 and 2) and Plexin As (Plxn As), have been associated to autism. Here we present data indicating that when overexpressed, Sema 3A causes human neural progenitors (NP) axonal retraction and an aberrant dendritic arborization. Similarly, Sema 3A, when overexpressed in human microglia, triggers proinflammatory processes that are highly detrimental to themselves as well as NP. Indeed, NP incubated in microglia overexpressing Sema 3A media retract axons within an hour and then start suffering and finally die. Sema 3A mediated retraction appears to be related to its binding to Npn 1 and Plxn A2 receptors, thus activating the downstream Fyn tyrosine kinase pathway that promotes the threonine-serine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5, CDK5, phosphorylation at the Tyr15 residue and the CDK5 processing to generate the active fragment p35.

Here, we investigate potential sex differences in glutamatergic transmission within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The goal of these experiments was to determine if there are baseline sex differences in transmission within this region that may underlie sex differences in diseases that involve dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex. Adult male and female C57Bl/6J mice were used for all experiments. Mice were killed and bilateral tissue samples were taken from the medial prefrontal cortex for western blotting. Both synaptosomal and total GluA1 and GluA2 levels were measured. In a second set of experiments, mice were killed and ex vivo slice electrophysiology was performed on prepared tissue from the medial prefrontal cortex. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and rectification indices were measured. Females exhibit higher levels of synaptosomal GluA1 and GluA2 in the mPFC compared to males. Despite similar trends, no statistically significant differences are seen in total levels of GluA1 and GluA2. Females also exhibit both a higher amplitude and higher frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and greater inward rectification in the mPFC compared to males. Overall, we conclude that there are sex differences in glutamatergic transmission in the mPFC. Our data suggest that females have higher levels of glutamatergic transmission in this region.

FSHD can be subdivided into two types: FSHD1, caused by contraction of the D4Z4 repeat on chromosome 4q35, and FSHD2, caused by mild contraction of the D4Z4 repeat plus aberrant hypomethylation mediated by genetic variants in SMCHD1, DNMT3B, or LRIF1. Genetic diagnosis of FSHD is challenging because of the complex procedures required. We applied Nanopore CRISPR/Cas9-targeted resequencing for the diagnosis of FSHD by simultaneous detection of D4Z4 repeat length and methylation status at nucleotide level in genetically-confirmed and suspected patients. We found significant hypomethylation of contracted 4q-D4Z4 repeats in FSHD1, and both 4q- and 10q-D4Z4 repeats in FSHD2. We also found that the hypomethylation in the contracted D4Z4 in FSHD1 is moderately correlated with patient phenotypes.

The total sample (n&#8201;=&#8201;1435) included individuals aged 40-70&#160;years from four counties (Oslo, Innlandet, Nordland and Tr&#248;ndelag) in Norway. Two online questionnaires were used to measure (1) awareness about dementia risk reduction and (2) an individual`s motivation to change behaviour for dementia risk reduction (MOCHAD-10). Of the participants, 70% were aware of the potential of dementia risk reduction in general. Physical inactivity (86%), cognitive inactivity (84%) and social isolation (80%) were the most frequently recognised dementia risk factors. On the other hand, diabetes (26%), coronary heart disease (19%), hearing loss (18%) and chronic kidney disease (7%) were less often recognised as dementia risk factors. Comparing men and women, the only significant difference was that women were more likely to report parents with dementia as a risk factor compared to men. Gender, age and educational differences were seen in beliefs and attitudes towards dementia prevention:women reported more negative feelings and attitudes towards dementia than men;those aged 40-49&#160;years - more likely than older age groups - reported that 'knowing family members with dementia' or 'having risk factors' made them believe they had to change their lifestyle and behaviour. The results indicate that 70% of the Norwegian public are aware of the potential for dementia risk reduction in general. However, there are major gaps in existing knowledge, particularly for cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia and metabolic factors (diabetes, obesity).

The identity of physiological ligands for this ENG-ALK1 signaling pertinent to AVM formation has yet to be clearly determined. To investigate whether bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), BMP10, or both are physiological ligands of ENG-ALK1 signaling involved in arteriovenous network formation, we generated a novel Bmp10 conditional knockout mouse strain. We examined whether global Bmp10-inducible knockout (iKO) mice develop AVMs at neonatal and adult stages in comparison with control, Bmp9-KO, and Bmp9/10-double KO (dKO) mice. Bmp10-iKO and Bmp9/10-dKO mice showed AVMs in developing retina, postnatal brain, and adult wounded skin, while Bmp9-KO did not display any noticeable vascular defects. Bmp10 deficiency resulted in increased proliferation and size of endothelial cells in AVM vessels. The impaired neurovascular integrity in the brain and retina of Bmp10-iKO and Bmp9/10-dKO mice was detected. Bmp9/10-dKO mice exhibited the lethality and vascular malformation similar to Bmp10-iKO mice, but their phenotypes were more pronounced. Administration of BMP10 protein, but not BMP9 protein, prevented retinal AVM in Bmp9/10-dKO and endothelial-specific Eng-iKO mice. These data indicate that BMP10 is indispensable for the development of a proper arteriovenous network, whereas BMP9 has limited compensatory functions for the loss of BMP10.

In addition, in the LOTC generalization of decoding across the orthogonal dimension was lower for sociality only in adolescents. These findings indicate that the representation of the content of others' actions, and in particular their social dimension, in the adolescent AON is still not as robust as in adults.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:The activity of the action observation network in the human brain is modulated according to the purpose of the observed action, in particular the extent to which it involves interaction with an object or with another person. How this conceptual representation of actions is implemented during development is largely unknown. Here, using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we discovered that, while the action observation network is in place in adolescence, the fine-grain organization of its posterior regions is less robust than in adults to decode the abstract social dimensions of an action. This finding highlights the late maturation of social processing in the human brain.", "query": "no_model"}, "36347546": {"ArticleTitle": "Clinical management of psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36347441": {"ArticleTitle": "Functional network properties derived from wide-field calcium imaging differ with wakefulness and across cell type.", "AbstractText": "To improve 'bench-to-bedside' translation, it is integral that knowledge flow bidirectionally-from animal models to humans, and vice versa.

We share a new pipeline (and test dataset) for the preprocessing of wide-field optical fluorescence imaging data-an emerging mode applicable in animal models-as well as results from a functional connectivity and graph theory analysis inspired by recent work in the human neuroimaging field. The approach is demonstrated using a dataset comprised of two test-cases: (1) data from animals imaged during awake and anesthetized conditions with excitatory neurons labeled, and (2) data from awake animals with different genetically encoded fluorescent labels that target either excitatory neurons or inhibitory interneuron subtypes. Both seed-based connectivity and graph theory measures (global efficiency, transitivity, modularity, and characteristic path-length) are shown to be useful in quantifying differences between wakefulness states and cell populations. Wakefulness state and cell type show widespread effects on canonical network connectivity with variable frequency band dependence. Differences between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons are observed, with somatostatin expressing inhibitory interneurons emerging as notably dissimilar from parvalbumin and vasoactive polypeptide expressing cells.

Here we address the contribution of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which catabolizes purines into uric acid and ROS in MFS aortopathy. In aortic samples from MFS patients, XOR protein expression, revealed by immunohistochemistry, increased in both the tunicae intima and media of the dilated zone. In MFS mice (Fbn1C1041G/+), aortic XOR mRNA transcripts and enzymatic activity of the oxidase form (XO) were augmented in the aorta of 3-month-old mice but not in older animals. The administration of the XOR inhibitor allopurinol (ALO) halted the progression of aortic root aneurysm in MFS mice. ALO administrated before the onset of the aneurysm prevented its subsequent development. ALO also inhibited MFS-associated endothelial dysfunction as well as elastic fiber fragmentation, nuclear translocation of pNRF2 and increased 3'-nitrotyrosine levels, and collagen maturation remodeling, all occurring in the tunica media. ALO reduced the MFS-associated large aortic production of H2O2, and NOX4 and MMP2 transcriptional overexpression. Allopurinol interferes in aortic aneurysm progression acting as a potent antioxidant.

Although there have been many studies of motor functions after hemidecortication, the analyses largely have been of general motor functions rather than of more skilled motor functions such as forelimb reaching. The objective of the present experiment was to analyze the sensorimotor forelimb function of rats after infant or adult hemidecortication by utilizing multiple motor analyses. Rats were given hemidecortications either on postnatal day 10 (P10) or day 90 (P90). Both groups were then tested on a number of behavioural tasks (two tests of skilled reaching, forelimb placing during spontaneous vertical exploration, and a sunflower seed opening task) beginning at P 120. In a portion of the P10 female animals, topographic movement representations were derived in the hemisphere contralateral to lesion using Intracortical Microstimulation (ICMS). The brains of the male animals were prepared for Golgi-Cox staining and subsequent analysis of dendritic arborisation and spine density. There were three main findings. 1) Both groups of hemidecorticate animals were impaired when tested on the motor tasks, but the impairments were qualitatively different in the neonatal and adult operates. For example, the P 10 hemidecorticate animals displayed simultaneous bilateral forelimb movement, or \"mirror movements.\" 2) Hemidecortication at P90 but not P10, led to increased dendritic arborisation of Layer III pyramidal cells in the intact parietal cortex but whereas P90 animals showed a decrease in cortical thickness in the intact hemisphere, the P10 animals do not, even though there are no callosal connections. 3) P10 hemidecortication altered the details of the ICMS-delineated motor maps in a small group of female hemidecorticates that were studied. In conclusion, there was postinjury compensation for motor impairments in both P10 and P90 rats but the mechanisms were different. Furthermore, comparisons of postinjury behavioral and anatomical compensation in rats with focal cortical injuries at those ages in our previous studies showed marked differences. These results suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the way that the brain compensates from hemidecortication and focal injury in development.", "query": "no_model"}, "36347341": {"ArticleTitle": "The neural mechanism of non-phase-locked EEG activity in task switching.", "AbstractText": "Flexible switching between different tasks is an important cognitive ability for humans and it is often studied using the task-switching paradigm. Although the neural mechanisms of task switching have been extensively explored in previous studies using event-related potentials techniques, the activity and process mechanisms of non-phase-locked electroencephalography (EEG) have rarely been revealed. For this reason, this paper discusses the processing of non-phase-locked EEG oscillations in task switching based on frequency-band delineation. First, the roles of each frequency band in local brain regions were summarized. In particular, during the proactive control process (the cue-stimulus interval), delta, theta, and alpha oscillations played more roles in the switch condition while beta played more roles in repeat task. In the reactive control process (post-target), delta, alpha, and beta are all related to sensorimotor function. Then, utilizing the functional connectivity (FC) method, delta connections in the frontotemporal regions and theta connections located in the parietal-to-occipital sites are involved in the preparatory period before task switching, while alpha connections located in the sensorimotor areas and beta connections located in the frontal-parietal cortex are involved in response inhibition. Finally, cross-frequency coupling (CFC) play an important role in working memory among different band oscillation. The present study shows that in addition to the processing mechanisms specific to each frequency band, there are some shared and interactive neural mechanism in task switching by using different analysis techniques.", "query": "no_model"}, "36347329": {"ArticleTitle": "", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36347231": {"ArticleTitle": "Neuroscience: Action history and the orbitofrontal cortex.", "AbstractText": "Decisions are often made in the absence of instructive cues, based instead on memories of previous actions and outcomes.

Low pitches confer advantages in perception and movement timing, and elicit stronger neural responses for timing compared to high pitches2, suggesting superior sensorimotor communication. Low frequency sound is processed via vibrotactile3 and vestibular4 (in addition to auditory) pathways, and stimulation of these non-auditory modalities in the context of music can increase ratings of groove (the pleasurable urge to move to music)3, and modulate musical rhythm perception4. Anecdotal accounts describe intense physical and psychological effects of low frequencies, especially in electronic dance music5, possibly reflecting effects on physiological arousal. We do not, however, know if these associations extend to direct causal effects of low frequencies in complex, real-world, social contexts like dancing at concerts, or if low frequencies that are not consciously detectable can affect behaviour. We tested whether non-auditory low-frequency stimulation would increase audience dancing by turning very-low frequency (VLF) speakers on and off during a live electronic music concert and measuring audience members' movements using motion-capture. Movement increased when VLFs were present, and because the VLFs were below or near auditory thresholds (and a subsequent experiment suggested they were undetectable), we believe this represents an unconscious effect on behaviour, possibly via vestibular and/or tactile processing.", "query": "no_model"}, "36347207": {"ArticleTitle": "Losing the sense of smell does not disrupt processing of odor words.", "AbstractText": "Whether language is grounded in action and perception has been a key question in cognitive science, yet little attention has been given to the sense of smell.

This manuscript provides an overview of trauma-related symptoms in the context of Ob-Gyn care and practical guidance of clinicians aiming to improve their detection and response to trauma in their clinical practice. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) describes a psychiatric illness which develops as a response to a traumatic event.

Screening for trauma in Ob-Gyn care can provide an opportunity to address risk and offer targeted intervention. Several brief evidence-based screening tools are available. Individuals who screen positive require assessment of immediate safety and targeted referrals. Trauma informed care describes an approach to healthcare aimed to enhance physical and emotional safety for patients and clinicians. Given the prevalence and the potentially devastating and enduring impact of trauma and trauma-related symptoms, there is a critical need to address trauma within Ob-Gyn care.

We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was ~ 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites.

Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, though mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in &#945;-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces &#945;-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet.

These models were chosen based on the size and diversity of their training data, but they also differed greatly in their processing methods and predictive algorithms.

The other model applied a 2D convolutional neural network (DBN) to minimally preprocessed slices of T1-weighted scans. Additional model variants were created to understand how generalizability changed when each model was trained with data that became more similar to the test samples in terms of age and acquisition protocols. Our results illustrated numerous trade-offs. The GTB predictions were relatively more accurate overall and yielded more reliable predictions when applied to lower quality scans. In contrast, the DBN displayed the most utility in detecting associations between brain age gaps and cognitive functioning.

Interictal spikes (IIS) and seizures were also analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Comparisons were made to the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy. We describe for the first time that hippocampal and cortical HFOs are a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice but no controls.

The extracellular lactate concentration, measured by a biosensor, rose quickly during brief and prolonged seizures. In two epilepsy models, mice lacking HCA1R (lactate receptor) were more susceptible to developing seizures. Moreover, HCA1R deficient (knock out, KO) mice developed longer and more severe seizures than wild-type littermates (WT). Lactate perfusion decreased neuronal tonic and phasic activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in GCAMP7 imaging experiments.

HCA1R activation reduced the spontaneous EPSC frequency and altered the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs in HCA1R WT but not in KO mice, suggesting it diminished presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters.

Where appropriate, the proportions between the groups were evaluated using Fisher's exact or Chi-square test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 128 responses (29.8%) from the 429 SCCAL members were available for the survey. 39.9% of respondents had a late FGR standardized protocol. Regarding non-severe FGR with normal fetal doppler, 70.8% suggested a fetal doppler study after one week (92/128), 13.8% (18/128) and 6.9% (9/128) proposed the exam, respectively, two and three times for a week. 0.8% (1/128) of respondents had a daily doppler exam, 7.7% (10/128) did not answer, and 3.1% (4/128) repeated the ultrasound exam to time for a week. The antenatal CTG was offered: 70.8% (92/128) of gynaecologists recommended one weekly CTG, whereas 13.8% (18/128) suggested two. 6.9% (9/128) recommended three weekly tests and 0.8% a daily test. 7.7% (10/128) of gynaecologists did not respond. At least, we investigated the gynaecologist's recommendations for outpatient EFW evaluation: 59.4% (76/128) repeated EFW after two weeks, 31.3% (40/128) after one week. 3.9% (4/128) and 3.1 (4/128) recommended EFW after three weeks and twice a week.

The aims of this article are to describe the development and evaluation of a training program that applied principles of trauma-informed care (TIC) to patient- and public-engaged research. A research partnership focused on addressing trauma in primary care patients (\"myPATH\") explicitly incorporated TIC into its formation, governance document, and collaborative processes, and developed and evaluated a free 3-credit continuing education online training. The training was presented by 11 partners (5 professional, 6 patient) and included academic content and lived experiences. Training participants (N = 46) positively rated achievement of learning objectives and speakers' performance (ranging from 4.39-4.74 on a 5-point scale). The most salient themes from open-ended comments were that training was informative (n = 12) and lived experiences shared by patient partners were impactful (n = 10). Suggestions were primarily technical or logistical. This preliminary evaluation indicates that it is possible to incorporate TIC principles into a research partnership's collaborative processes and training about these topics is well-received. Learning about trauma and TIC may benefit research partnerships that involve patients and public stakeholders studying a wide range of health conditions, potentially improving how stakeholders engage in co-producing research as well as producing research that addresses how trauma relates to their health condition under study. The myPATH Partnership includes 22 individuals with professional and lived experiences related to trauma (https://www.usf.edu/cbcs/mhlp/centers/mypath/); nine partners were engaged due to personal experiences with trauma; other partners are community-based providers and researchers.

However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes, and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ultra-high field in both male humans and rodent populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly, steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rats that, first, showed that downregulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine increased accumbal GSH levels in rats and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type-specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and an individual's capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time.

Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the <i>in vivo</i> human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus <i>in vivo</i> and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain. The brain allows us to perceive and interact with our environment and to create and recall memories about our day-to-day lives. A sea-horse shaped structure in the brain, called the hippocampus, is critical for translating our perceptions into memories, and it does so in coordination with other brain regions. For example, different regions of the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain) support different aspects of cognition, and pathways of information flow between the cerebral cortex and hippocampus underpin the healthy functioning of memory. Decades of research conducted into the brains of non-human primates show that specific regions of the cerebral cortex anatomically connect with different parts of the hippocampus to support this information flow. These insights form the foundation for existing theoretical models of how networks of neurons in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex are connected. However, the human cerebral cortex has greatly expanded during our evolution, meaning that patterns of connectivity in the human brain may diverge from those in the brains of non-human primates. Deciphering human brain circuits in greater detail is crucial if we are to gain a better understanding of the structure and operation of the healthy human brain. However, obtaining comprehensive maps of anatomical connections between the hippocampus and cerebral cortex has been hampered by technical limitations. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an approach that can be used to study the living human brain, suffers from insufficient image resolution. To overcome these issues, Dalton et al. used an imaging technique called diffusion weighted imaging which is used to study white matter pathways in the brain. They developed a tailored approach to create high-resolution maps showing how the hippocampus anatomically connects with the cerebral cortex in the healthy human brain. Dalton et al. produced detailed maps illustrating which areas of the cerebral cortex have high anatomical connectivity with the hippocampus and how different parts of the hippocampus preferentially connect to different neural circuits in the cortex. For example, the experiments demonstrate that highly connected areas in a cortical region called the temporal cortex connect to very specific, circumscribed regions within the hippocampus. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may consist of different neural circuits, each preferentially linked to defined areas of the cortex which are, in turn, associated with specific aspects of cognition. These observations further our knowledge of hippocampal-dependant memory circuits in the human brain and provide a foundation for the study of memory decline in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.", "query": "no_model"}, "36345711": {"ArticleTitle": "Sex differences and risk factors for bleeding in Alagille syndrome.", "AbstractText": "Spontaneous bleeds are a leading cause of death in the pediatric JAG1-related liver disease Alagille syndrome (ALGS).

Additionally, micro-Doppler imaging revealed unique microvascular morphology of surrounding healthy vasculature.

Neuroimaging revealed a hypoplastic corpus callosum and subcortical white-matter abnormalities. Notably, this patient did not exhibit periventricular heterotopias previously observed in other patients with ARF1 variants (including p.R99H). Functional analysis of the R99H-ARF1 variant protein revealed that it was expressed at normal levels and properly localized to the Golgi apparatus; however, expression of this variant caused swelling of the Golgi apparatus, increased the recruitment of coat proteins such as COPI, AP-1, and GGA3, and altered the morphology of recycling endosomes. In addition, we observed that expression of R99H-ARF1 prevented dispersal of the Golgi apparatus by the ARF1-inhibitor brefeldin A. Finally, protein-interaction analyses showed that R99H-ARF1 bound more tightly to the ARF1-effector GGA3 relative to wild-type ARF1. These properties were similar to those of the well-characterized constitutively-active Q71L-ARF1 mutant, indicating that the pathogenetic mechanism of the R99H-ARF1 variant involves constitutive activation with resultant Golgi and endosomal alterations. The absence of periventricular nodular heterotopias in this R99H-ARF1 subject also indicates this finding may not be a consistent phenotypic expression of all ARF1-related disorders.", "query": "no_model"}, "36345141": {"ArticleTitle": "Generational, sex, and socioeconomic inequalities in mental and social wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic: prospective longitudinal observational study of five UK cohorts.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36345094": {"ArticleTitle": "Excess resource use and costs of physical comorbidities in individuals with mental health disorders: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.", "AbstractText": "Individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) have worse physical health than the general population, utilise healthcare resources more frequently and intensively, incurring higher costs.

Substantial differences exist between MHDs, with depressive disorder tending towards lower average excess resource use and cost estimates, while excess resource use ranges between +6% to +320% and excess costs between +14% to +614%.

Here, we aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures. We included Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal, n = 121) or Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively normal to dementia, n = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for independent validation (controls/Alzheimer's disease-spectrum=46/65). All participants underwent baseline 18F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial R2) between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to capture patient-specific cognitive decline. In both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99&#177;7.69] and A05 [age = 74.03&#177;9.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort.

We report that ARID1a knockdown resulted in a significant global decrease in chromatin accessibility in ATAC-Seq analysis, as well as affecting a subset of genome-wide GR binding sites determined by analyzing GR ChIP-Seq data. Interestingly, the specific effects on gene expression were limited to a relatively small subset of glucocorticoid-regulated genes, notably those involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. The vast majority of glucocorticoid-regulated genes were largely unaffected by ARID1a knockdown or functional interference, consistent with a more specific role for ARID1a in glucocorticoid function than previously speculated. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we have identified a chromatin-associated protein complex comprising GR, ARID1a, and several DNA damage repair proteins including P53 binding protein 1 (P53BP1), Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1), DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), DNA mismatch repair protein MSH6 and splicing factor proline and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ), as well as the histone acetyltransferase KAT7, an epigenetic regulator of steroid-dependent transcription, DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation. Not only was this protein complex ablated with both ARID1a knockdown and functional interference, but spontaneously arising DNA damage was also found to accumulate in a manner consistent with impaired DNA damage repair mechanisms. Recovery from dexamethasone-dependent cell cycle arrest was also significantly impaired.

Variation in the regulation of this activity is thought to give rise to normal variation in human traits, and disruptions are thought to potentially underlie a spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., Autism, Schizophrenia, Downs' Syndrome, intellectual disability). Hypotheses related to E/I dysfunction have the potential to provide cross-diagnostic explanations and to combine genetic and neurological evidence that exists within and between psychiatric conditions. However, the hypothesis has been difficult to test because: (1) it lacks specificity-an E/I dysfunction could pertain to any level in the neural system- neurotransmitters, single neurons/receptors, local networks of neurons, or global brain balance - most researchers do not define the level at which they are examining E/I function; (2) We lack validated methods for assessing E/I function at any of these neural levels in humans. As a result, it has not been possible to reliably or robustly test the E/I hypothesis of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort or longitudinal patient studies. Currently available, in vivo markers of E/I in humans either carry significant risks (e.g., deep brain electrode recordings or using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with radioactive tracers) and/or are highly restrictive (e.g., limited spatial extent for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).

Routine follow-up of patients allows clinicians to anticipate replacement of the DBS battery reaching the end of its life. Patients who experience a sudden stop of the DBS battery experience a rapid worsening of symptoms unresponsive to high dose of levodopa, in a life-threatening phenomenon called \"DBS-withdrawal syndrome.\" In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which many surgeries are being deprogrammed, it is of utmost importance to determine to what extent DBS battery replacement surgeries should be considered an emergency. In this study, we attempt to identify risk factors of DBS-withdrawal syndrome and provide new insights about pathophysiological hypotheses. We then elaborate on the optimal approach to avoid and manage such a situation. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the subject and reported the cases of 20 patients (including five from our experience) with DBS-withdrawal syndrome, comparing them with 15 undisturbed patients (including three from our experience), all having undergone neurostimulation discontinuation. A long disease duration at battery removal and many years of DBS therapy are the main potential identified risk factors (p&#160;< 0.005). In addition, a trend for older age at the event and higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score before initial DBS implantation (evaluated in OFF-drug condition) was found (p&#160;< 0.05).

Therefore, we sought to examine the associations between prestroke physical activity, stroke severity, and all-cause mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage in comparison with ischemic stroke. This was a longitudinal, register-based cohort study. All adult patients with intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemic stroke admitted to 3 stroke units in Gothenburg, Sweden, between November 1, 2014, and June 30, 2019, were screened for inclusion. Physical activity was defined as light physical activity &#8805;4 h/wk or moderate physical activity &#8805;2 h/wk the year before stroke. Stroke severity was assessed on admission using the NIH Stroke Scale. All-cause mortality rates were followed up to 7 years, from the time of incident stroke until death or censoring. Ordinal logit models and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted associations of prestroke physical activity. We included 763 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and 4,425 with ischemic stroke. Prestroke physical activity was associated with less severe strokes by an adjusted odds ratio of 3.57 (99% CI 2.35-5.47) for intracerebral hemorrhages and 1.92 (99% CI 1.59-2.33) for ischemic strokes.

There, ribbon synapses also encode sensory signals as events comprising two or more vesicles released simultaneously. The implications of such coordinated multivesicular release (MVR) for spike generation are not known. Here we investigate how MVR alters the transmission of sensory information compared to Poisson synapses employing a pure rate code. We used leaky integrate-and-fire models incorporating the statistics of release measured experimentally from glutamatergic synapses of retinal bipolar cells in zebrafish (both sexes) and compared these with models assuming Poisson inputs constrained to operate at the same average rates. We find that MVR can increase the number of spikes generated per vesicle while reducing interspike intervals and latency to first spike. The combined effect was to increase the efficiency of information transfer (bits per vesicle) over a range of conditions mimicking target neurons of different size. MVR was most advantageous in neurons with short time-constants and reliable synaptic inputs, when less convergence was required to trigger spikes. In the special case of a single input driving a neuron, as occurs in the auditory system of mammals, MVR increased information transfer whenever spike generation required more than one vesicle. This study demonstrates how presynaptic integration of vesicles by MVR can increase the efficiency with which sensory information is transmitted compared to a rate code described by Poisson statistics.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:Neurons communicate by the stochastic release of vesicles at the synapse and the statistics of this process will determine how information is represented by spikes. The classical model is that vesicles are released independently by a Poisson process, but this does not hold at ribbon-type synapses specialized to transmit the first electrical signals in vision and hearing, where two or more vesicles can fuse in a single event by a process termed coordinated multivesicular release (MVR).

Studying animal models of monogenic syndromes associated with ASD, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can offer insights into its aetiology. Here, we show that loss of function of the Drosophila NF1 ortholog results in tactile hypersensitivity following brief mechanical stimulation in the larva (mixed sexes), paralleling the sensory abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Mutant larvae also exhibit synaptic transmission deficits at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ), with increased spontaneous but reduced evoked release. While the latter is homeostatically compensated for by a postsynaptic increase in input resistance, the former is consistent with neuronal hyperexcitability. Indeed, diminished expression of NF1 specifically within central cholinergic neurons induces both excessive neuronal firing and tactile hypersensitivity, suggesting the two may be linked. Furthermore, both impaired synaptic transmission and behavioural deficits are fully rescued via knockdown of Ras proteins. These findings validate NF1-/- Drosophila as a tractable model of ASD with the potential to elucidate important pathophysiological mechanisms.Significance statement:Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1-2% of the overall population and can considerably impact an individual's quality of life.

Earlier reports have shown that mice and rat hippocampus expresses mainly the RyR2 isoform, with lower expression levels of the RyR3 isoform and almost undetectable levels of the RyR1 isoform; both the RyR2 and RyR3 isoforms have central roles in synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory processes.

Autophagy is a catabolic process in eukaryotic cells that allows the lysosome to recycle the cell's own contents, such as organelles and proteins, known as autophagic cargo. Their most significant role is to keep cells alive in distressed situations. Mitophagy is also crucial for reducing abnormal protein aggregation and increasing organelle clearance and partly accounts for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, substantial data indicate that any disruption in these homeostatic mechanisms leads to the emergence of several age-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. So, targeting autophagy and mitophagy might be a potential therapeutic strategy for a variety of health conditions.", "query": "no_model"}, "36343726": {"ArticleTitle": "Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Superficial Prefrontal White Matter in Healthy Aging.", "AbstractText": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a heterogenous structure that is highly susceptible to the effects of aging.

This study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to examine the effects of age, sex, and intracranial volume (ICV) on superficial WM within specific PFC subregions, and to model the relationships with age using higher order polynomial regression modelling. PFC WM of 140 healthy individuals, aged 18-85, was segmented into medial and lateral orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal subregions. Differences due to age in microstructural parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities, and macrostructural measures of tract volumes, fiber counts, average fiber lengths, and average number of fibers per voxel were examined. We found that most prefrontal subregions demonstrated age effects, with decreases in FA, tract volume, and fiber counts, and increases in all diffusivity measures. Age relationships were mostly non-linear, with higher order regressions chosen in most cases. Declines in PFC FA began at the onset of adulthood while the greatest changes in diffusivity and volume did not occur until middle age. The effects of age were most prominent in medial tracts while the lateral orbitofrontal tracts were less affected. Significant effects of sex and ICV were also observed in certain parameters.

At the same time, the how short-term learning affects RS and its modulation by P(rep) remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we used fMRI and measured the RS and its modulation by P(rep) for non-face objects (cars) before and after a 10-day long perceptual learning (PL) period and for unfamiliar faces as control. The results showed a significant P(rep) effect for faces within the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and for cars within the Lateral Occipital Complex (LO) in the pre-training fMRI measurement session. Following the PL period, participants exhibited strong improvements in the subordinate categorization of the trained stimuli. Surprisingly, the magnitude of RS did not change as a function of training, but the P(rep) effect was absent in the post-training fMRI sessions for both stimulus categories.

Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is efficacious in alleviating motor symptoms, but has several notable side-effects, most likely reflecting the non-specific nature of electrical stimulation and/or the brain regions targeted. We determined whether specific optogenetic activation of glutamatergic motor thalamus (Mthal) neurons alleviated forelimb akinesia in a chronic rat model of PD. Parkinsonian rats (unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injection) were injected with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV5-CaMKII-Chrimson-GFP) to transduce glutamatergic Mthal neurons with the red-shifted Chrimson opsin. Optogenetic stimulation with orange light at 15 Hz tonic and a physiological pattern, previously recorded from a Mthal neuron in a control rat, significantly increased forelimb use in the reaching test (p<0.01). Orange light theta burst stimulation, 15 Hz and control reaching patterns significantly reduced akinesia (p<0.0001) assessed by the step test. In contrast, forelimb use in the cylinder test was unaffected by orange light stimulation with any pattern. Blue light (control) stimulation failed to alter behaviours.

Binge-like ethanol exposure during adolescence promotes dysregulation of neurotrophic responses and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These effects include changes in proliferation, regulation, differentiation, and maturation of neurons, and there is indication that such effects may be disproportionate between sexes. This study determined whether sex impacts neurotrophic responses and neurogenesis in adulthood after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. To determine this, adolescent rats underwent AIE with ethanol (5 g/kg). In adulthood, animals were euthanized, and immunohistochemical techniques and ELISAs were utilized to determine AIE effects on sex-specific neurogenesis factors and neurotrophic markers, respectively. AIE exposure led to a significant decrease in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation indicated by reductions in the numbers of DCX+, SOX2+ and Ki-67+ cells in male and female AIE-exposed rats. Additionally, AIE increased markers for the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946;, in the hippocampus into adulthood in male AIE-exposed rats only. No significant AIE-induced differences were observed in the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-&#946;, nor in the neurotrophic factors BDNF and GDNF. Altogether, our findings indicate that although AIE did not have a persistent effect on hippocampal neurotrophic levels, there was still a reduction in neurogenesis. The neurogenic impairment was not sex specific, but the neurogenic deficits in males may be attributed to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. A persistent impairment in neurogenesis may have an impact on both behavioral maladaptations and neurodegeneration in adulthood.", "query": "no_model"}, "36343703": {"ArticleTitle": "Geographical distribution of host's specific SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "AbstractText": "To assess, if the SARS-CoV-2 mutate in a similar pattern globally or has a specific pattern in any given population.

In this article I argue that in behavioural scientists' endeavours to answer this question, fruitful research pathways and their ensuing discoveries have come to exist alongside popular, yet in the light of current empirical evidence, highly questionable scenarios and even scientific blind alleys.

The most extreme versions of this perspective suffer logical incoherence and severe limits on scientific testability. By contrast the field has generated a range of rigorous observational and experimental methodologies that have revealed both long-term cultural fidelity and limited forms of CCE in non-human species.

Cerebral oedema is marked by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), tissue herniation and reduced cerebral perfusion pressure. In clinical settings, osmotherapy has been a common practice to decrease ICP. However, there are no guidelines on the choice of administration protocol parameters such as injection doses, infusion time and retention time. Most importantly, the effects of osmotherapy have been proven controversial since the infusion of osmotic agents can lead to a range of side effects. Here, a new Finite Element model of brain oedema and osmotherapy is thus proposed to predict treatment outcome. The model consists of three components that simulate blood perfusion, oedema, and osmotherapy, respectively. In the perfusion model (comprising arteriolar, venous, and capillary blood compartments), an anatomically accurate brain geometry is used to identify regions with a perfusion reduction and potential oedema occurrence in stroke. The oedema model is then used to predict ICP using a porous circulation model with four fluid compartments (arteriolar blood, venular blood, capillary blood, and interstitial fluid). In the osmotherapy model, the osmotic pressure is varied and the changes in ICP during different osmotherapy episodes are quantified. The simulation results of the model show excellent agreement with available clinical data and the model is employed to study osmotherapy under various parameters.

Even though MCI patients showed impaired visuospatial attentional processing and working memory, previous neuropsychological experiments in MCI largely emphasized memory impairment and lacked substantiating evidence of whether memory impairment could be associated with how patients with MCI encode objects in space.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants in the genes coding for major structures in the opioid and serotonergic systems can affect pain modulation in FM patients and healthy controls (HC). Conditioned pain modulation (CPM), evaluating the effects of ischemic pain on pressure pain sensitivity, was performed in 82 FM patients and 43 HC. All subjects were genotyped for relevant functional polymorphisms in the genes coding for the &#956;-opioid receptor (OPRM1, rs1799971), the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, 5-HTTLPR/rs25531) and the serotonin 1a receptor (5-HT1a, rs6295). Results showed the OPRM1 G-allele was associated with decreased CPM. A significant gene-to-gene interaction was found between the OPRM1 and the 5-HT1a gene. Reduced CPM scores were seen particularly in individuals with the OPRM1 G*/5-HT1a CC genotype, indicating that the 5-HT1a CC genotype seems to have an inhibiting effect on CPM if an individual has the OPRM1 G-genotype. Thus, regardless of pain phenotype, the OPRM1 G-allele independently as well as with an interaction with the 5-HT1a gene influenced pain modulation. FM patients had lower CPM than HC but no group differences were found regarding the genetic effects on CPM, indicating that the results reflect more general mechanisms influencing pain modulatory processes rather than underlying the dysfunction of CPM in FM. In conclusion, a genetic variant known to alter the expression of, and binding to, the my-opioid receptor reduced a subject's ability to activate descending pain inhibition. Also, the results suggest a genetically inferred gene-to-gene interaction between the main opioid receptor and a serotonergic structure essential for 5-HT transmission to modulate pain inhibition.

Structural equation modelling estimated genetic and environmental contributions to cardiometabolic risk profiles. All analyses were stratified by sex (n = 1509 men, n = 1967 women). Three classes were identified in men: 1) \"Healthy\" (52.3%), 2) \"Central obesity, high triglycerides, high fasting plasma glucose\" (40.2%), and 3) \"Central obesity, high triglycerides, diabetes\" (7.6%).

In chimpanzees, concealing visual cues of paternity may be beneficial due to their promiscuous mating system and the considerable risk of infanticide by males. On the other hand, detecting kin can also aid chimpanzees in avoiding inbreeding and in forming alliances that improve kin-mediated fitness. Although previous studies assessing relatedness based on facial resemblance in chimpanzees exist, they used images of captive populations in whom selection pressures and reproductive opportunities are controlled and only assessed maternity or paternity of adult offspring. In natural populations, the chances of infanticide are highest during early infancy, suggesting that young infants would benefit most from paternity concealment, whereas adults and subadults would benefit from the detection of all types of kin, including half-siblings. In our experiment, we conducted an online study with human participants, in which they had to assess the relatedness of chimpanzees based on facial similarity. To address previous methodological constraints, we used chimpanzee images across all ages, as well as maternal and paternal half-siblings. We found that kin status was detected above chance across all relatedness categories, with easier kin detection of father-offspring pairs, females, and older chimpanzees.

LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11&#160;h. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy subjects who underwent two 14-h sessions and received ketanserin (40&#160;mg p.o.) or placebo 1&#160;h after LSD (100 &#181;g p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12&#160;h. Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5&#160;h with placebo to 3.5&#160;h. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of BDNF levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors.

To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on ~2000 cells isolated from the human semitendinosus muscle of young individuals. This demonstrated the presence of two poorly described cell populations. First, we detected a vascular-related cell type that expressed pericyte and pan-endothelial genes that we localized to large blood vessels within skeletal muscle cross-sections and termed stromal pericytes. RNA velocity analysis demonstrated that stromal pericytes may represent a \"transition state\" between endothelial cells and pericytes. Analysis of published scRNAseq datasets revealed evidence for stromal pericytes in trunk and heart musculature, which showed transcriptional similarity. Additionally, we identified a subset of FAPs expressing TWIST2 mRNA and protein. Human TWIST2-expressing cells were anatomically and transcriptionally comparable to mouse Twist2 cells as they were restricted to the myofiber interstitium, expressed fibrogenic genes but lacked satellite cell markers and colocalized with the FAPs marker PDGFR&#945; in human muscle cross-sections.

First, we discuss neuroembryology and physiology data that do not support a role for ependymal cilia as the primary propeller of CSF movement across the ventricles in the human brain, particularly during in utero development prior to the functional maturation of ependymal cilia.

Instead, gene mutations affecting motile cilia function impact not only ependymal cilia but also motile cilia found in other organ systems outside of the brain, causing a clinical syndrome of recurrent respiratory infections and situs inversus, symptoms that do not typically accompany most cases of human hydrocephalus. Finally, we postulate that certain cases of hydrocephalus associated with ciliary gene mutations may arise not necessarily just from loss of cilia-generated CSF flow but also from altered neurodevelopment, given the potential functions of ciliary genes in signaling and neural stem cell fate beyond generating fluid flow.

Method: EEG signals of 169 BD patients and 45 controls were cleaned from the artifacts and processed using two different DL methods: a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) combined with the long-short term memory (LSTM) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN).

To identify new epigenetic regulators of melanoma plasticity, we combined data mining, tumor models, proximity proteomics, and CUT&RUN sequencing. We focus on the druggable family of bromodomain epigenetic readers and identify TRIM28 as a new regulator of melanoma plasticity. We find that TRIM28 promotes the expression of pro-invasive genes and that TRIM28 controls the balance between invasiveness and growth of melanoma cells. We demonstrate that TRIM28 acts via the transcription factor JUNB that directly regulates the expression of pro-invasive and pro-growth genes. Mechanistically, TRIM28 controls the expression of JUNB by negatively regulating its transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II.

A major challenge with inferring parameters in HH models is non-uniqueness: many different sets of ion channel parameter values produce similar outputs for the same input stimulus. Such phenomena result in an objective function that exhibits multiple modes (i.e., multiple local minima). This non-uniqueness of local optimality poses challenges for parameter estimation with many algorithmic optimization techniques. HH models additionally have severe non-linearities resulting in further challenges for inferring parameters in an algorithmic fashion. To address these challenges with a tractable method in high-dimensional parameter spaces, we propose using a particular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which has the advantage of inferring parameters in a Bayesian framework. The Bayesian approach is designed to be suitable for multimodal solutions to inverse problems. We introduce and demonstrate the method using a three-channel HH model. We then focus on the inference of nine parameters in an eight-channel HH model, which we analyze in detail. We explore how the MCMC algorithm can uncover complex relationships between inferred parameters using five injected current levels. The MCMC method provides as a result a nine-dimensional posterior distribution, which we analyze visually with solution maps or landscapes of the possible parameter sets. The visualized solution maps show new complex structures of the multimodal posteriors, and they allow for selection of locally and globally optimal value sets, and they visually expose parameter sensitivities and regions of higher model robustness.

They are composed of four families, namely the &#956; (MOPR), &#954; (KOPR), &#948; (DOPR), and nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOPR) opioid receptors systems. These receptors signal through the action of their endogenous opioid peptides &#946;-endorphins, dynorphins, enkephalins, and nociceptins, respectfully, to maintain homeostasis under normal physiological states. Due to their prominent role in pain regulation, exogenous opioids-primarily targeting the MOPR, have been historically used in medicine as analgesics, but their ability to produce euphoric effects also present high risks for abuse. The ability of pain and opioid use to perturb endogenous opioid system function, particularly within the central nervous system, may increase the likelihood of developing opioid use disorder (OUD). Today, the opioid crisis represents a major social, economic, and public health concern. In this review, we summarize the current state of the literature on the function, expression, pharmacology, and regulation of endogenous opioid systems in pain. Additionally, we discuss the adaptations in the endogenous opioid systems upon use of exogenous opioids which contribute to the development of OUD.

Our aim was to uncover novel MRGPRX2-selective and -potent agonists as drug candidates responsible for clinical features of pseudo-allergic DHRs. We conducted a primary high-throughput screening (HTS), coupled with mutagenesis targeting the MRGPRX2 N62S mutation, on a panel of 3,456 library compounds.

The objective of this work was therefore to investigate the composition of segmented SCI lesions using quantitative MRI for R  2 *   and quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping (QSM). 211 SCI lesions were segmented from 32 participants with SCA and 6 controls.

Currently, there is no definitive chemotherapy among the studied options. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on surgical brain injuries in patients treated for GBM. Materials and Methods: This randomized, phase II, placebo, triple-blinded, controlled trial was performed on 36 patients with a diagnosis of GBM. All the patients received DMF (240 mg, three-times per day) or placebo (with the same shape and administration route) one week before surgery. Also, patients in both groups after the operation received standard treatments (radiotherapy plus chemotherapy). In addition, Kanofsky's performance status (KPS) score was evaluated at baseline and one month later. Also, serum S100&#946; was measured 48 hours before and after surgery. Results: There was no significant difference among DMF and control groups with regard to age, gender, and the extent of resections (P&#707;0.05). The most adverse event in both groups was a headache. Although the serum S100&#946; level was not markedly changed after surgery, the mean KPS in the DMF group was higher than in the control group after surgery.

While more common during childhood, they can persist into, or present de novo, during adulthood. Parasomnias can arise out of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as in confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors or sleep-related eating disorder, or out of REM sleep, as in REM behaviour disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis or nightmare disorder. Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with a parasomnia. A thorough clinical history, including a collateral history if available, is crucial to identify characteristic clinical features. Video polysomnography is useful to identify macro- and micro-sleep architectural features, characteristic behavioural events, and any concomitant sleep pathologies.

Additionally, we analyzed the cortical features and the association with inflammatory biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Thirty-three patients were selected from a prospective cross-sectional study cohort during the ongoing pandemic (August 2020-April 2021) at the university hospitals of Basel and Zurich (Switzerland). The group included patients with different neurological symptom severity (Class I: nearly asymptomatic/mild symptoms, II: moderate symptoms, III: severe symptoms). Thirty-three healthy age and sex-matched subjects that underwent the same MRI protocol served as controls. For each anatomical T1w MPRAGE image, regional cortical gray matter volume, thickness, and surface area were computed with FreeSurfer.

Interestingly, the onset of presbycusis coincides with the highest occurrence of tinnitus. The aim of this study was to identify age, hearing loss, and tinnitus related functional changes, within the auditory system and its associated structures. Seventy-eight participants were selected for the study based on their age, hearing, and tinnitus, and they were divided into six groups: young controls (Y-NH-NT), subjects with mild presbycusis (O-NH-NT) or expressed presbycusis (O-HL-NT), young subjects with tinnitus (Y-NH-T), subjects with mild presbycusis and tinnitus (O-NH-T), and subjects with expressed presbycusis and tinnitus (O-HL-T). An MRI functional study was performed with a 3T MRI system, using an event related design (different types of acoustic and visual stimulations and their combinations). The amount of activation of the auditory cortices (ACs) was dependent on the complexity of the stimuli; higher complexity resulted in a larger area of the activated cortex. Auditory stimulation produced a slightly greater activation in the elderly, with a negative effect of hearing loss (lower activation). The congruent audiovisual stimulation led to an increased activity within the default mode network, whereas incongruent stimulation led to increased activation of the visual cortex. The presence of tinnitus increased activation of the AC, specifically in the aged population, with a slight prevalence in the left AC. The occurrence of tinnitus was accompanied by increased activity within the insula and hippocampus bilaterally. Overall, we can conclude that expressed presbycusis leads to a lower activation of the AC, compared to the elderly with normal hearing; aging itself leads to increased activity in the right AC. The complexity of acoustic stimuli plays a major role in the activation of the AC, its support by visual stimulation leads to minimal changes within the AC.

The precise mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis and the generation of EEG delta oscillations are still being investigated. Activity-dependent neuronal calcium influx has been hypothesized to play an important role in generating delta oscillations and might be involved in downstream signaling that mediates sleep function. Dihydropyridine blockers of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are in wide clinical use to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders and are readily blood-brain-barrier penetrant. We therefore, wanted to investigate their potential effects on EEG delta oscillation and homeostatic NREM sleep regulation in freely behaving mice. In vivo two-photon imaging of cortical neurons showed larger spontaneous calcium transients in NREM sleep compared to waking. Application of the dihydropyridine calcium blocker nicardipine significantly reduced cortical calcium transients without affecting the generation of delta oscillations. Nicardipine also did not affect EEG delta oscillations over 24 h following application. The time spent in NREM sleep and NREM episode duration was also not affected.

Screening tools such as alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) and AUDIT-C are used, following which the diagnosis and severity of AUD are determined using DSM-5 criteria. The management of AUD in patients with ALD is best carried out using an integrated approach involving psychiatrists and gastroenterologists/hepatologists. The treatment most often involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions which try to achieve and maintain abstinence. Although, there is limited evidence, Baclofen is the first line pharmacological agent for long-term management of AUD in patients with ALD. Intensive psychological interventions such as motivation enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are also seen to be beneficial. Treatment retention and follow-up are vital and can positively influence outcomes.", "query": "no_model"}, "36340278": {"ArticleTitle": "Are Nocebo Effects in Adulthood Linked to Prenatal Maternal Cortisol Levels?", "AbstractText": "Placebo-induced adverse events, or nocebo effects, occur when doctor-patient communication anticipates the onset of negative symptoms. They have been found to correlate with the anxiety-related activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Here we try to determine if prenatal hyperactivity of this system, as assessed through plasma cortisol, may influence nocebo effects in adulthood. We investigated the rate and magnitude of nocebo effects in 378 adults whose prenatal maternal plasma cortisol was measured during the first, second and third trimester of pregnancy. The healthy subjects underwent a nocebo oxygen challenge. This consisted of the inhalation of fake (placebo) oxygen and assessment of the following adverse events: headache, chest pain, abdominal pain, and cough. Plasma cortisol responses during the nocebo adverse events were also measured. 41 out of 46 (89.1%) subjects who reported 3 adverse events, and 37 out of 37 (100%) subjects who reported 4 adverse events had prenatal maternal cortisol above normal levels. By contrast, only 10 out of 143 (7%) subjects who reported 0 adverse events showed prenatal maternal cortisol above the normal range. Moreover, whereas subjects who reported 3 and 4 adverse events showed a significant increase in plasma cortisol following the nocebo challenge, subjects who reported 0 adverse events showed no changes. These findings emphasize the importance of the doctor-patient communication in perceiving symptoms like pain, and suggest that those subjects with high prenatal maternal cortisol may be more sensitive to the effects of a negative communication in adulthood.", "query": "no_model"}, "36340270": {"ArticleTitle": "An Experience Sampling Measure of the Key Features of Rumination.", "AbstractText": "Research indicates that rumination can be viewed as a dynamic process that fluctuates over time, within hours and days. An increasing number of intensive longitudinal studies on rumination are accordingly being conducted and published using experiencing sampling methodology (ESM), a technique with measurements in everyday life. Yet, this literature suffers from a profound caveat: rumination has so far been conceptualized and measured as a unitary construct in these ESM studies. This is unfortunate, since such a unitary view contrasts with prominent contemporary models that regard rumination as a multifaceted construct, wherein the key features are not interchangeable and should therefore be measured separately. Moreover, no validated ESM measure of the key features of rumination has yet been developed. Therefore, we developed and validated an ESM protocol and the first ESM questionnaire to assess rumination as a multifaceted construct, measuring five features of rumination. We conducted an ESM study in a community sample of 40 French-speaking participants. They answered the five rumination ESM items in French four times a day for fourteen days. At the end of the ESM assessment period, participants completed trait-like questionnaires of rumination, depression, and general anxiety. The ESM rumination items exhibited good psychometric properties, including excellent within-person variability and convergent validity with corresponding trait-like constructs. Although further validation is warranted, this novel ESM assessment protocol of rumination as a multifaceted construct (validated in French and translated into English) will allow future researchers to study how rumination's features fluctuate and interact with other constructs over time.", "query": "no_model"}, "36340268": {"ArticleTitle": "Monocarboxylate Transporters: Role and Regulation in Corneal Diabetes.", "AbstractText": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic diseases that is known to cause structural and functional ocular complications. In the human cornea, DM-related complications affect the epithelium, stroma, and nerves. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are a family of proton-linked plasma membrane transporters that carry monocarboxylates across plasma membranes. In the context of corneal health and disease, their role, presence, and function are largely undetermined and solely focused on the most common MCT isoforms, 1 through 4. In this study, we investigated the regulation of MCT1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10, in corneal DM, using established 3D self-assembled extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro models. Primary stromal corneal fibroblasts were isolated from healthy (HCFs), type I (T1DMs), and type II (T2DMs) DM donors. Monoculture 3D constructs were created by stimulating stromal cells on transwells with stable vitamin C for two or four weeks. Coculture 3D constructs were created by adding SH-SY5Y neurons at two different densities, 12&#8201;k and 500&#8201;k, on top of the monocultures. Our data showed significant upregulation of MCT1 at 4 weeks for HCF, T1DM, and T2DM monocultures, as well as the 500&#8201;k nerve cocultures. MCT8 was significantly upregulated in HCF and T1DM monocultures and all of the 500&#8201;k nerve cocultures. Further, MCT10 was only expressed at 4 weeks for all cocultures and was limited to HCFs and T1DMs in monocultures. Immunofluorescence analysis showed cytoplasmic MCT expression for all cell types and significant downregulation of both MCT2 and MCT4 in HCFs, when compared to T1DMs and T2DMs. Herein, we reveal the existence and modulation of MCTs in the human diabetic cornea in vitro. Changes appeared dependent on neuronal density, suggesting that MCTs are very likely critical to the neuronal defects observed in diabetic keratopathy/neuropathy.

We investigated the effects of selective D3 antagonist, GSK598809, on the neural response to negative emotional processing in substance dependent individuals and healthy controls. Functional MRI BOLD response was assessed during an evocative image task, 2 h following acute administration of GSK598809 (60 mg) or placebo in a multi-site, double-blind, pseudo-randomised, cross-over design. Abstinent drug dependent individuals (DD, n = 36) comprising alcohol-only (AO, n = 19) and cocaine-alcohol polydrug (PD, n = 17) groups, and matched controls (n = 32) were presented with aversive and neutral images in a block design (contrast of interest: aversive > neutral). Whole-brain mixed-effects and a priori ROI analyses tested for group and drug effects, with identical models exploring subgroup effects. No group differences in task-related BOLD signal were identified between DD and controls. However, subgroup analysis revealed greater amygdala/insular BOLD signal in PD compared with AO groups. Following drug administration, GSK598809 increased BOLD response across HC and DD groups in thalamus, caudate, putamen, and pallidum, and reduced BOLD response in insular and opercular cortices relative to placebo. Multivariate analyses in a priori ROIs revealed differential effects of D3 antagonism according to subgroup in substantia nigra; GSK598809 increased BOLD response in AO and decreased response in PD groups. Acute GSK598809 modulates the BOLD response to aversive image processing, providing evidence that D3 antagonism may impact emotional regulation. Enhanced BOLD response within D3-rich mesolimbic regions is consistent with its pharmacology and with attenuation of substance-related hypodopaminergic function. However, the lack of group differences in task-related BOLD response and the non-specific effect of GSK598809 between groups makes it difficult to ascertain whether D3 antagonism is likely to be normalising or restorative in our abstinent populations. The suggestion of differential D3 modulation between AO and PD subgroups is intriguing, raising the possibility of divergent treatment responses. Further study is needed to determine whether D3 antagonism should be recommended as a treatment target in substance dependence.", "query": "no_model"}, "36339856": {"ArticleTitle": "Influence of clinical and neurocognitive factors in psychosocial functioning after a first episode non-affective psychosis: Differences between males and females.", "AbstractText": "Deficits in psychosocial functioning are present in the early stages of psychosis. Several factors, such as premorbid adjustment, neurocognitive performance, and cognitive reserve (CR), potentially influence functionality. Sex differences are observed in individuals with psychosis in multiple domains. Nonetheless, few studies have explored the predictive factors of poor functioning according to sex in first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study aimed to explore sex differences, examine changes, and identify predictors of functioning according to sex after onset. The initial sample comprised 588 individuals. However, only adults with non-affective FEP (n = 247, 161 males and 86 females) and healthy controls (n = 224, 142 males and 82 females) were included. A comprehensive assessment including functional, neuropsychological, and clinical scales was performed at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. A linear regression model was used to determine the predictors of functioning at 2-year follow-up. FEP improved their functionality at follow-up (67.4% of both males and females). In males, longer duration of untreated psychosis (&#946; = 0.328, p = 0.003) and worse premorbid adjustment (&#946; = 0.256, p = 0.023) were associated with impaired functioning at 2-year follow-up, while in females processing speed (&#946; = 0.403, p = 0.003), executive function (&#946; = 0.299, p = 0.020) and CR (&#946; = -0.307, p = 0.012) were significantly associated with functioning. Our data indicate that predictors of functioning at 2-year follow-up in the FEP group differ according to sex. Therefore, treatment and preventative efforts may be adjusted taking sex into account. Males may benefit from functional remediation at early stages. Conversely, in females, early interventions centered on CR enhancement and cognitive rehabilitation may be recommended.", "query": "no_model"}, "36339851": {"ArticleTitle": "Synthetic cannabinoid JWH-073 alters both acute behavior and in vivo/vitro electrophysiological responses in mice.", "AbstractText": "JWH-073 is a synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) that is illegally marketed within an \"herbal blend\", causing psychoactive effects more intense than those produced by Cannabis.

The present study is aimed to investigate the in vivo pharmacological activity on physiological and neurobehavioral parameters in male CD-1 mice after acute 1 mg/kg JWH-073 administration. To this aim we investigate its effect on sensorimotor (visual, acoustic, and tactile), motor (spontaneous motor activity and catalepsy), and memory functions (novel object recognition; NOR) in mice coupling behavioral and EEG data. Moreover, to clarify how memory function is affected by JWH-073, we performed in vitro electrophysiological studies in hippocampal preparations using a Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) stimulation paradigm. We demonstrated that acute administration of JWH-073 transiently decreased motor activity for up to 25 min and visual sensorimotor responses for up to 105 min, with the highest effects at 25 min (~48 and ~38%, respectively), while the memory function was altered up to 24 h (~33%) in treated-mice as compared to the vehicle.

Though helpful in choosing potential interventions based on the available regimens, this conceptualization of psychiatric diseases can limit basic science investigation into their underlying causes. The reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis of dopamine neuron function posits that phasic dopamine signals encode the difference between the rewards a person expects and experiences. The computational framework from which this hypothesis was derived, temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), is largely focused on reward processing rather than punishment learning. Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by aberrant behaviors, expectations, reward processing, and hypothesized dopaminergic signaling, but also characterized by suffering and the inability to change one's behavior despite negative consequences. In this review, we provide an overview of the RPE theory of phasic dopamine neuron activity and review the gains that have been made through the use of computational reinforcement learning theory as a framework for understanding changes in reward processing. The relative dearth of explicit accounts of punishment learning in computational reinforcement learning theory and its application in neuroscience is highlighted as a significant gap in current computational psychiatric research. Four disorders comprise the main focus of this review: two disorders of traditionally hypothesized hyperdopaminergic function, addiction and schizophrenia, followed by two disorders of traditionally hypothesized hypodopaminergic function, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Insights gained from a reward processing based reinforcement learning framework about underlying dopaminergic mechanisms and the role of punishment learning (when available) are explored in each disorder.

We here aimed to examine the cognitive mechanisms underlying impaired PRL task performance in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUDP) using computational models of reinforcement learning. Twenty-eight early abstinent AUDP and 27 healthy controls (HC) performed an extensive PRL paradigm. We compared conventional behavioral variables of choices (perseveration; correct responses) between groups. Moreover, we fitted Bayesian computational models to the task data to compare differences in latent cognitive variables including reward and punishment learning and choice consistency between groups. AUDP and HC did not significantly differ with regard to direct perseveration rates after reversals. However, AUDP made overall less correct responses and specifically showed decreased win-stay behavior compared to HC. Interestingly, AUDP showed premature switching after no or little negative feedback but elevated proneness to stay when accumulation of negative feedback would make switching a more optimal option. Computational modeling revealed that AUDP compared to HC showed enhanced learning from punishment, a tendency to learn less from positive feedback and lower choice consistency. Our data do not support the assumption that AUDP are characterized by increased perseveration behavior.

However, their application in disease modeling remains limited as other neuronal subtypes (e.g., glutamatergic, GABAergic) are also implicated in neurological disorders, and no current protocols exist to generate these subtypes of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Our study aimed to evaluate the use of a xeno-free version of B-27, a supplement commonly used in neuronal culture, for SH-SY5Y maintenance and differentiation. To evaluate the proliferative capacity of SH-SY5Y cells cultured in B-27, we performed growth curve analyses, immunocytochemical staining for Ki-67 and qRT-PCR to track changes in cell cycle progression. SH-SY5Y cells cultured in FBS or under serum-starved conditions were used as controls. We observed that SH-SY5Y cells show reduced growth and proliferation rates accompanied by decreased CDK6 and CDK1 expression following 4-day exposure to B-27, suggesting B-27 induces a quiescent state in SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly, this reduced growth rate was not due to increased apoptosis. As cell cycle exit is associated with differentiation, we next sought to determine the fate of SH-SY5Y cells cultured in B-27. B-27-cultured SH-SY5Y cells show changes in cell morphology, adopting pyramidal shapes and extending neurites, and upregulation of neuronal differentiation markers (GAP43, TUBB3, and SYP).

However, detailed literature on the antiepileptic properties of the genus Artemisia and its mechanism of action is segregated. In this review, we tried to gather the detailed neuroprotective and antiepileptic properties of the genus Artemisia and its possible underlying mechanisms. In this respect, 63 articles were identified in the PubMed and Google scholars databases, from which 18 studies were examined based on the pharmacological use of the genus Artemisia species in epilepsy. The genus Artemisia extracts have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neurotransmitter-modulating, anti-apoptotic, anticonvulsant, and pro-cognitive properties by modulating oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial ROS production and an imbalance of antioxidant enzymes, by protecting mitochondrial membrane potential required for ATP production, by upregulating GABA-A receptor and nACh receptor activities, and by interfering with various anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 pathway and Nrf2 pathway. This review provides detailed information about some species of the genus Artemisia as potential antiepileptic agents. Hence, we recommend further investigations on the purification and identification of the most biological effective compounds of Artemisia and the mechanisms of their action to cure epilepsy and other neurological diseases.", "query": "no_model"}, "36339574": {"ArticleTitle": "Synergistic association of resveratrol and histone deacetylase inhibitors as treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "AbstractText": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with motor neuron degeneration, progressive paralysis and finally death. Despite the research efforts, currently there is no cure for ALS. In recent years, multiple epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. A pathological role for histone hypoacetylation and the abnormal NF-&#954;B/RelA activation involving deacetylation of lysines, with the exclusion of lysine 310, has been established in ALS. Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-&#954;B/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate. The combination of the epigenetic drugs, by rescuing RelA and the H3 acetylation state, promotes a beneficial and sexually dimorphic effect on disease onset, survival and motor neurons degeneration.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology was used to identify the potential active ingredients of YHT. In mice, menopause-like symptoms were induced by combination of bilateral ovariectomy and empty bottle stimulation. The mice were then treated with the YHT aqueous extract for three weeks. Behavior, sleep state, body weight, organ index, and histomorphology were analyzed separately. Additionally, network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to predict the mechanisms underlying the action of YHT. Finally, serum estradiol was quantified to preliminarily verify the results of network pharmacology. YHT not only improved the behavior of mice (attack and explore behavior reduced; modify behavior increased) but also ameliorated the sleep state (sleep time increased and incubation time reduced). YHT reduced body weight, increased uterine weight, and improved the histomorphology of some organs. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed that the estrogen signaling pathway might play a key role in attenuating menopause-like symptoms. Furthermore, YHT treatment reversed the reduction in serum estradiol levels.

The second aim was to compare the quality of life of these persons with a normative population and with patients with chronic pain. Health-related quality of life, as a measure for a person's overall physical, mental, and social wellbeing, was measured with the 3-level EQ5D in 547 post-COVID-19 infected persons. These data were compared to reference data from normal population records for Belgium and to data from patients with chronic pain after spinal surgery with two-way analyses of variance.

Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are functionally coated with thermoresponsive poly (oligo (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (POEGMA) brushes loaded with dopamine. Dopamine loaded MNPs-POEGMA are co-cultured with primary striatal neurons. When alternating magnetinec fields (AMF) are applied, MNPs undergo hysteresis power loss and dissipate heat.

AMF-triggered dopamine release enhances the response of dopamine ion channels expressed on the cell membranes enhancing the activity of ~50% of striatal neurons subjected to the treatment. Chemomagnetic actuation on dopamine receptors is confirmed by blocking D1 and D2 receptors. The reversible thermodynamic phase transition of POEGMA brushes allow the on-demand release of dopamine in multiple microdoses.

Results showed that participation in adapted sport has a positive effect on bone health in athletes with unilateral lower limb amputation but is not sufficient to maintain adequate levels of bone mineralization at the impaired hip in athletes with above-knee amputation.

However, the association between exercise-induced changes in gut microbiota and CVD risk have not been investigated. Objective: This study determined the effects of exercise training on CVD risk and gut microbiota in physically active elderly women and whether exercise-induced gut microbiota changes were associated with CVD risk. Methods: An 8-week randomized controlled trial was conducted with 14 elderly women assigned to exercise group (n = 8) or control group (n = 6). Physical function, sarcopenic obesity, and metabolic syndrome were evaluated as components of CVD risk. Gut microbiota composition was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

A multimodal MRI, symptom-guided region-of-interest (ROI) approach is likely to yield more consistent results. The functions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia transcend many common concussion symptoms, and thus these regions, plus the white matter tracts that connect or project from them, constitute plausible ROIs for MRI analysis.

Youth SRC is associated with acute cerebellar inflammation accompanied by reduced cerebellar activity and cerebellar-parietal connectivity, as well as structural changes of the middle regions of the corpus callosum accompanied by functional changes of the caudate, all of which resolve with recovery.

The use of compound words in Chinese enables significant sublexical ambiguity, requiring varying executive load during word recognition: when a word's constituent characters carry multiple meanings, readers must consider the meaning contributions of both constituent characters and use top-down word information to determine the most accurate meaning of the ambiguous character, a process termed \"sublexical ambiguity resolution.\" In this study, adults read real Chinese words (including both sublexically ambiguous and unambiguous words) and pseudowords, and they were asked to make lexical decisions. Older adults exhibited greater lexicality effects (i.e., real words were easier to be identified than pseudowords) and similar sublexical ambiguity effects compared with young adults. Among older participants, processing speed could account for their ability to differentiate between words and pseudowords. In contrast, the level of perceived loneliness modulated the efficacy of sublexical ambiguity resolution: the participants with higher perceived loneliness displayed a greater sublexical ambiguity disadvantage effect. These results indicate that perceived loneliness may affect the use of contextual information in meaning retrieval during reading. The findings provide an important link between social connections and language processing.", "query": "no_model"}, "36337544": {"ArticleTitle": "Synchronizing with the rhythm: Infant neural entrainment to complex musical and speech stimuli.", "AbstractText": "Neural entrainment is defined as the process whereby brain activity, and more specifically neuronal oscillations measured by EEG, synchronize with exogenous stimulus rhythms. Despite the importance that neural oscillations have assumed in recent years in the field of auditory neuroscience and speech perception, in human infants the oscillatory brain rhythms and their synchronization with complex auditory exogenous rhythms are still relatively unexplored. In the present study, we investigate infant neural entrainment to complex non-speech (musical) and speech rhythmic stimuli; we provide a developmental analysis to explore potential similarities and differences between infants' and adults' ability to entrain to the stimuli; and we analyze the associations between infants' neural entrainment measures and the concurrent level of development. 25 8-month-old infants were included in the study. Their EEG signals were recorded while they passively listened to non-speech and speech rhythmic stimuli modulated at different rates. In addition, Bayley Scales were administered to all infants to assess their cognitive, language, and social-emotional development. Neural entrainment to the incoming rhythms was measured in the form of peaks emerging from the EEG spectrum at frequencies corresponding to the rhythm envelope. Analyses of the EEG spectrum revealed clear responses above the noise floor at frequencies corresponding to the rhythm envelope, suggesting that - similarly to adults - infants at 8 months of age were capable of entraining to the incoming complex auditory rhythms.

We have conducted an electronic search in MEDLINE, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus scientific databases targeting studies published between 2000 till 2019. Several modalities have shown a wide spectrum of the effectiveness of weight control among adolescents. Despite achieving short-term success among obese adolescents, maintaining such change is challenging. The emergence of metabolic or bariatric surgeries has opened the door for long-term control over weight gain with considerable remission of unfavorable metabolic mediated or modulated effects associated with obesity such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The most commonly practiced metabolic surgery among adolescents is sleeve gastrectomy which is associated with comparable weight and metabolic control and a lesser risk of complication. Anesthesia is considered a major challenge among the pediatric population, especially those with significant obesity. Preoperative evaluation is always warranted to exclude and manage different associated comorbidities. The anesthetic challenges associated with pediatric obesity begin with intubation. Maintenance and emergence from anesthesia along with postoperative antiemetics and analgesia can pose additional challenges. Managing the postoperative period is considered a cornerstone in the early detection and management of any postoperative complication.

While substantial evidence implicates a distributed cortical network serving adaptive control when behavioural changes are required (e.g. response inhibition), the neural dynamics serving such control when the target motor commands are to remain intact are poorly understood. To address this, we developed a novel proactive-reactive cued finger tapping paradigm that was performed during magnetoencephalography by 25 healthy adults. Importantly, to ensure condition-wise differences in adaptive cueing were not attributable to changes in movement kinematics, motor selection and planning processes were held constant despite changes in task demands. All data were imaged in the time-frequency domain using a beamformer to evaluate the effect of proactive and reactive cues on movement-related oscillations and subsequent performance. Our results indicated spectrally specific increases in low (i.e. theta) and high (i.e. gamma) frequency oscillations during motor execution as a function of adaptive cueing. Additionally, we observed robust cross-frequency coupling of theta and gamma oscillatory power in the contralateral motor cortex and further, the strength of this theta-gamma coupling during motor execution was differentially predictive of behavioural improvements and decrements during reactive and proactive trials, respectively.

The study was a randomized crossover design in which cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment participants consumed a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet or American Heart Association diet for 6 weeks, followed by other diet after washout. L1 cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin and neural cell adhesion molecule surface markers were used to enrich for neuron-secreted small extracellular vesicles (sEVL1CAM, sEVSYP and sEVNCAM). For the first time, we have presented multiple evidences, including immunogold labelling/transmission electron microscopy, clusters of differentiation 63-ELISA-based assay, confocal microscopy fluorescent images and flow cytometry data confirming the presence of L1 cell adhesion molecule on the surface of sEVL1CAM, validating purity and relative abundance of sEVL1CAM in the plasma.

Moreover, sEVL1CAMshowed better sensitivity compared with CSF in analysing increased glutamate (6-folds, P < 0.0001) from mild cognitive impairment participants following modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention. sEVL1CAM characterization also suggested that modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet differentially targets the expression of various glutamate receptors-glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA1, glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA2A, glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA2B and glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA type subunit 1. Importantly, these sEVL1CAM measures strongly correlated with corresponding clinical CSF biomarkers (neurogranin, amyloid beta 1-42, neurofilament light and tau). Furthermore, sEVL1CAM were loaded with less advanced glycation endproducts and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity following modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet intervention.

The pooled exosomal extracts from each group were analyzed for Ng, MFN-2, LAMP-2, and golgin A4 by western blot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence method of detection. The densitometric analysis of immunoreactive bands demonstrated a 65% reduction of Ng in AD and 53% in FTD. Mitochondrial protein MFN-2 showed a significant reduction by 32% in AD and 46% in FTD. Lysosomal LAMP-2 and Golgi complex associated golgin A4 were considerably increased in both AD and FTD. Changes in Ng may reflect the ongoing synaptic degeneration that are linked to cognitive disturbances in AD and FTD. Importantly, the rate of synaptic degeneration was more pronounced in AD.

All participants had CSF neurochemical (NCM) biomarker analyses (A&#946;1-42, T-tau, P-tau181, and Nf-L) and underwent 19-channel resting-state EEG. From the EEG spectra, dominant frequency peaks were extracted in four regions resulting in four dominant frequencies. This produced eight features (4 NCM + 4 EEG). When NCM and EEG markers were combined, the diagnostic accuracy increased significantly. In the whole group, the accuracy went up from 79% (NCM) to almost 82%, while in the definite group only, it went up from around 85% to almost 95% . Two differences in the occurrence of the dominant EEG frequency were discovered: people lacking a clear dominant peak almost all had definite AD, while people with two peaks more often had FTLD. Combining EEG with NCM biomarkers resulted in differential diagnostic accuracies of 82% in clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients and of 95% in patients having a definite diagnosis, which was significantly better than with EEG or NCM biomarkers alone.

This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase II trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase III trials. Lecanemab is currently under examination for an 'Accelerated Approval' in the US, with an expected decision in January 2023. The common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies, compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. In the first part of this review, we underlined through a meta-analysis that the pooled data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials demonstrated a significant but slight clinical effect after 18 months. Still, safety remains an issue with serious and symptomatic amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which are seldom (&#8764;1 per 200 treated patients) but occur beyond chance. In the second part of this review, we hypothesized that there is a high probability that some phase III trials of high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies in early AD will finally be unarguably positive on clinical outcomes in the next five years with acceptable safety data. This may, in turn, lead to approval by the European Medicine Agency if the risk-benefit profile is deemed favorable. Such approval would be a game-changer in managing AD patients and for the organization of memory clinics in France.

The effector functions of (auto)antibodies are determined by their constant domain, which defines the antibody isotype and subclass. The most prevalent isotype in serum is IgG, which is often the only isotype used in diagnostic testing. Nevertheless, autoantibody responses can have their own unique isotype/subclass profile. Because comparing autoantibody isotype profiles may yield new insights into disease pathophysiology, here we summarize the isotype/subclass profiles of the most prominent autoantibodies. Despite substantial variation between (and within) autoantibody responses, this unprecedented comparison shows that autoantibodies share distinctive isotype patterns across different diseases. Although most autoantibody responses are dominated by IgG (and mainly IgG1), several specific diseases are characterized by a predominance of IgG4. In other diseases, IgE plays a key role. Importantly, shared features of autoantibody isotype/subclass profiles are seen in clinically unrelated diseases, suggesting potentially common trajectories in response evolution, disease pathogenesis, and treatment response. Isotypes beyond IgG are scarcely investigated in many autoantibody responses, leaving substantial gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.

In contrast to the dual-stream model predicting either no effect or a selective effect on the stimulated phonological-dorsal stream (as well as to a general multisensory effect on both reading streams), we found that only word-reading performance improved after active bilateral PPC tRNS. These findings demonstrate a direct neural connectivity between the PPC, controlling visuo-spatial attention, and the ventral stream for visual word recognition.

Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of Meteorin, a neurotrophic factor, in reversing neuropathic pain in rodent models of peripheral nerve injury induced by physical trauma. Here, we sought to investigate the potential antinociceptive effects of recombinant mouse Meteorin (rmMeteorin) using a paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy model in male and female mice. Paclitaxel treatment (4&#8239;&#215;&#8239;4mg/kg, i.p.) induced hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity by day 8 after treatment. Thereafter, in a reversal dosing paradigm, five repeated injections of rmMeteorin (0.5 and 1.8mg/kg s.c. respectively) administered over 9 days produced a significant and long-lasting attenuation of mechanical hypersensitivity in both sexes. Additionally, administration of rmMeteorin (0.5 and 1.8mg/kg), initiated before and during paclitaxel treatment (prevention dosing paradigm), reduced the establishment of hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity. Repeated systemic administration of rmMeteorin in both dosing paradigms decreased histochemical signs of satellite glial cell reactivity as measured by glutamine synthetase and connexin 43 protein expression in the DRG. Additionally, in the prevention administration paradigm rmMeteorin had a protective effect against paclitaxel-induced loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers. Our findings indicate that rmMeteorin has a robust and sustained antinociceptive effect in the paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy model and the development of recombinant human Meteorin could be a novel and effective therapeutic for CIPN treatment.

In the spinal cord, such manipulations may promote repair in conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, but may also limit excessive cell proliferation contributing to tumours such as ependymomas. We show that when ambient &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is increased in vigabatrin-treated or decreased by GAD67 allele haplodeficiency in glutamic acid decarboxylase67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) mice of either sex, the numbers of proliferating cells respectively decreased or increased. Thus, intrinsic spinal cord GABA levels are correlated with the extent of cell proliferation, providing important evidence for manipulating these levels. Diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous protein that interacts with GABA receptors and its breakdown product, octadecaneuropeptide, which preferentially activates central benzodiazepine (CBR) sites, were highly expressed in spinal cord, especially in ependymal cells surrounding the central canal. Furthermore, animals with reduced CBR activation via treatment with flumazenil or Ro15-4513, or with a G2F77I mutation in the CBR binding site had greater numbers of Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine positive cells compared to control, which maintained their stem cell status since the proportion of newly proliferated cells becoming oligodendrocytes or astrocytes was significantly lower. Altering endogenous GABA levels or modulating GABAergic signaling through specific sites on GABA receptors therefore influences NSC proliferation in the adult spinal cord. These findings provide a basis for further study into how GABAergic signaling could be manipulated to enable spinal cord self-regeneration and recovery or limit pathological proliferative activity.", "query": "no_model"}, "36336003": {"ArticleTitle": "Computational modeling of the effect of five mutations on the structure of the ACE2 receptor and their correlation with infectivity and virulence of some emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2 suggests mechanisms of binding affinity dysregulation.", "AbstractText": "Interactions between the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are critical for virus entry into the host cell. The objective of this work was to identify some of the most relevant SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with human variants of ACE2 since some ACE2 variants can enhance or reduce the affinity of the interaction between the ACE2 and S proteins. However, no information has been sought to extrapolate to different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, to understand the impact on the affinity of the interaction between ACE2 protein variants and SARS-CoV-2 protein S variants, molecular docking was used in this study to predict the effects of five mutations of ACE2 when they interact with Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron variants and a hypothetical variant, which present mutations in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Our results suggest that these variants could alter the interaction of the Spike and the human ACE2 protein, losing or creating new inter-protein contacts, enhancing viral fitness by improving binding affinity, and leading to an increase in infectivity, virulence, and transmission. This investigation highlighted that the ACE2 S19P mutation decreases the binding affinity between the ACE2 and Spike proteins in the presence of the Beta variant and the wild-type variant of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan-2019. The R115Q mutation of ACE2 lowers the binding affinity of these two proteins in the presence of the Beta and Delta variants. Similarly, K26R lowers the affinity of the interaction between the ACE2 and Spike proteins in the presence of the Alpha variant. This decrease in binding affinity is probably due to the lack of interaction between some of the key residues of the interaction complex between the ACE2 protein and the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Therefore, ACE2 mutations appear in the presence of these variants, they could suggest an intrinsic resistance to COVID-19 disease. On the other hand, our results suggested that the K26R, M332L, and K341R mutations of ACE2 expressively showed the affinity between the ACE2 and Spike proteins in the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. Consequently, these ACE2 mutations in the presence of the Alpha, Beta, and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 could be more infectious and virulent in human cells compared to the SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan-2019 and it could have a negative prognosis of the disease. Finally, the Omicron variant in interaction with ACE2 WT, S19P, R115Q, M332L, and K341R mutations of ACE2 shows a significant decrease in binding affinity. This could be consistent with that the Omicron variant causing less severe symptoms than previous variants (Ren et al., 2022); Lauring, 2022). On the other hand, our results suggested Omicron in the complex with K26R, the binding affinity is increased between ACE2/RBD, which could indicate a negative prognosis of the disease in people with these allelic conditions.", "query": "no_model"}, "36335974": {"ArticleTitle": "Mortality and life-years lost following subsequent physical comorbidity in people with pre-existing substance use disorders: a national registry-based retrospective cohort study of hospitalised individuals in Czechia.", "AbstractText": "Substance use disorders constitute a major global public health problem, attributable largely to their subsequent comorbidity with other health conditions. This study aimed to investigate the risk of all-cause death and life-years lost following hospitalisation for 28 subsequent physical comorbid conditions in people with a previous hospitalisation for substance use disorder, compared with matched counterparts without substance use disorder. We did a retrospective cohort study on data from Czech nationwide registers of all-cause hospitalisations and deaths during the period from Jan 1, 1994, to Dec 31, 2017. The cohorts consisted of individuals who had initially been hospitalised between 15 and 70 years of age (index hospitalisation) and who were subsequently hospitalised with one or more of 28 comorbid physical health conditions. We included individuals with an index hospitalisation for substance use disorders and up to three counterparts without substance use disorders with a subsequent hospitalisation for the same physical health condition, with matching on sex, age (&#177;3 years), work status, and discharge year at first hospitalisation for the subsequent condition. Data on ethnicity were not available. Risk of death due to any cause following the first hospitalisation for each physical health condition until Dec 31, 2017, and life-years lost after disease onset at ages 30, 45, and 60 years, and before 81 years of age, were examined. From a total 56&#8201;229&#8201;563 records of hospitalisations identified, we included 121&#8201;153 people with hospitalisation for substance use disorders and 6&#8201;742&#8201;134 people without hospitalisation for substance use disorders in the study. The 28 condition-specific cohorts comprised a median of 6444 individuals (IQR 2033-12&#8201;358), ranging from 444 for multiple sclerosis to 36&#8201;356 for diseases of the circulatory system. Across the cohorts, the proportion of males ranged from 31&#183;4% for thyroid disorder to 100&#183;0% for prostate disorders.

After adjusting for potential confounders using stratified Cox proportional hazards models, individuals with a pre-existing substance use disorder had an increased risk of death due to any cause after the onset of 26 out of 28 physical health conditions, relative to their counterparts without substance use disorders, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 1&#183;15 (1&#183;09-1&#183;21) for chronic liver disease to 3&#183;86 (2&#183;62-5&#183;67) for thyroid disorder. For seven subsequent health conditions, the risk of death was more than doubled in the group with pre-existing substance use disorders. When compared with the general population via mortality tables, people with pre-existing substance use disorders had substantial losses in life-years after the onset of most of the subsequent physical health conditions regardless of age of onset, and, for the majority of comorbidities, lost considerably more life-years than their counterparts without substance use disorders. A history of hospitalisation for substance use disorders appears to have a significant negative effect on prognosis following the development of various subsequent physical health conditions.

The existence of this basic metacognition raises the question of the variables influencing its development at such a young age and whether such early skills could predict successful cognitive performance. The current study had two main goals: (a) exploring the relation between parental metacognitive style and children's early metacognition and (b) determining whether these early metacognitive skills can predict children's memory performance. To this end, 2.5- to 4.5-year-old children (N&#160;=&#160;72) and their parents were recruited. To assess parental metacognitive style, parent-child dyads were invited to participate in a 15-min session during which they played memory games. The parents' speech during this session was later coded for metacognitive content. Children's memory was assessed using cued recall and recognition tests. During one of these recognition tests, participants had the opportunity to ask for a cue to help them decide whether their response was correct (i.e., metacognitive measure). Results revealed that parental metacognitive style predicted both children's metacognitive accuracy and memory performance. Interestingly, a mediation effect of children's metacognitive skills on the relation between parental style and memory performance was found.

The present case study aimed to investigate whether prism adaptation could induce beneficial aftereffects in a tinnitus sufferer. A 75-year-old man, R. B., with chronic unilateral tinnitus in the left ear reported a self-estimation of parameters of his tinnitus-discomfort, pitch and loudness-and performed a manual line-bisection task to study the consequences of lateralized auditory disorder on spatial representation. Aftereffects of prism adaptation were assessed using a sensorimotor open-loop pointing task. In parallel, a control group completed the line-bisection task and the open-loop pointing task before and after lens exposure, under the same experimental condition as those of R. B. Throughout the pretests, the patient assessed his tinnitus at a constant medium pitch (around 3000&#160;Hz), and he was biased toward the affected ear in both the sensorimotor task and the estimation of the subjective center in the manual line-bisection task. Although both optical deviations were effective, an exposure to prism adaptation to a rightward optical deviation (i.e., toward the unaffected ear) produced stronger aftereffects. In posttests, the tinnitus pitch decreased to 50&#160;Hz and the subjective center was shifted toward the right side (i.e., unaffected ear side). Furthermore, the line-bisection task seemed to reflect the changes in the tinnitus perception, and spatial representation could be a new tool to assess tinnitus indirectly.

The present study utilized a unique very long-access binge and crash procedure of METH self-administration to characterize the sequelae of pathological alterations that occur with METH-associated cardiomyopathy. Rats were allowed to intravenously self-administer METH for 96&#160;h continuous weekly sessions over 8 weeks. Cardiac function, histochemistry, ultrastructure, and biochemical experiments were performed 24&#160;h after the cessation of drug administration. Voluntary METH self-administration induced pathological cardiac remodeling as indicated by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis accompanied by compromised cardiac systolic function. Ultrastructural examination and native gel electrophoresis revealed altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) supercomplexes (SCs) stability and assembly in METH exposed hearts. Redox-sensitive assays revealed significantly attenuated mitochondrial respiratory complex activities with a compensatory increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity reminiscent of metabolic remodeling. Increased autophagy flux and increased mitochondrial antioxidant protein level was observed in METH exposed heart. Treatment with mitoTEMPO reduced the autophagy level indicating the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the adaptive activation of autophagy in METH exposed hearts. Altogether, we have reported a novel METH-associated cardiomyopathy model using voluntary drug seeking behavior.

However, cognitive and motor cortical regions are differentially activated depending on whether the task emphasizes semantic or phonological aspects of speech. Here we tested whether processing of cocktail-party speech differs when participants perform a shadowing (immediate speech repetition) task compared to an attentive listening task in the presence of irrelevant speech. Participants viewed audiovisual dialogues with concurrent distracting speech during functional imaging. Participants either attentively listened to the dialogue, overtly repeated (i.e., shadowed) attended speech, or performed visual or speech motor control tasks where they did not attend to speech and responses were not related to the speech input. Dialogues were presented with good or poor auditory and visual quality. As a novel result, we show that attentive processing of speech activated the same network of sensory and frontal regions during listening and shadowing. However, in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), peak activations during shadowing were posterior to those during listening, suggesting that an anterior-posterior distinction is present for motor vs. perceptual processing of speech already at the level of the auditory cortex. We also found that activations along the dorsal auditory processing stream were specifically associated with the shadowing task. These activations are likely to be due to complex interactions between perceptual, attention dependent speech processing and motor speech generation that matches the heard speech. Our results suggest that interactions between perceptual and motor processing of speech relies on a distributed network of temporal and motor regions rather than any specific anatomical landmark as suggested by some previous studies.", "query": "no_model"}, "36335125": {"ArticleTitle": "Epigenetic Alterations of Repeated Relapses in Patient-matched Childhood Ependymomas.", "AbstractText": "Recurrence is frequent in pediatric ependymoma (EPN).

Eating behavior was measured using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire and stress using the Perceived Stress Scale. The associations between stress and eating behavior were analyzed using linear mixed effects models for repeated measurements. Perceived stress measured after the active behavior change stage (at 6 months) did not predict changes in eating behavior during the behavior maintenance stage.

In the baseline LLAEP recording, the TG had significantly later N1, P3a, and P3b latencies, as well as significantly lower P3a and P3b amplitudes.

The present paper proposes a method to decompose over feature spaces the variance explained by a banded ridge regression model. It also describes how banded ridge regression performs a feature-space selection, effectively ignoring non-predictive and redundant feature spaces. This feature-space selection leads to better prediction accuracy and to better interpretability. Banded ridge regression is then mathematically linked to a number of other regression methods with similar feature-space selection mechanisms.

Similar phenotypic effects are also observed in rodents when treated chronically with the stress hormone corticosterone. In this study, we investigated the neuropsychological consequences of chronic corticosterone treatment in male rats using two translational rodent assays of affective bias, the judgement bias task (JBT) and affective bias test (ABT). We also used the reward learning assay (RLA) and sucrose preference test (SPT) to quantify reward-related behaviours. Negative biases in decision-making were observed in the chronic corticosterone-treated group but only when the treatment was given shortly before each behavioural session. The same dose of corticosterone, when given daily after completion of the behavioural session had no effects. Chronic corticosterone treatment did not potentiate negative affective biases in the ABT induced by either an acute pharmacological or stress manipulation but both reward learning and reward sensitivity were blunted. Analysis of the brain tissue from animals receiving chronic corticosterone found reduced hippocampal neurogenesis consistent with previous studies suggesting corticosterone-induced neurotrophic deficits. Taken together, these data suggest chronic corticosterone treatment induces neuropsychological effects related to changes in reward learning, memory and negative biases in decision making, but these decision-making biases depend on whether rewarding outcomes were experienced during the acute effects of the drug. These findings suggest an important interaction between psychological and biological factors resulting in negative biases in decision-making in this model.", "query": "no_model"}, "36334532": {"ArticleTitle": "A Reinforcement Meta-Learning framework of executive function and information demand.", "AbstractText": "Gathering information is crucial for maximizing fitness, but requires diverting resources from searching directly for primary rewards to actively exploring the environment.

Given the need to treat larger brain regions beyond the hippocampus and EC, brain volumes and locations treated with FUS have now expanded. To evaluate any potential adverse consequences of BBB opening on disease progression, the authors report safety, imaging, and clinical outcomes among participants with mild AD at 6-12 months after FUS treatment targeted to the hippocampus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe. In this open-label trial, participants with mild AD underwent MRI-guided FUS sonication to open the BBB in &#946;-amyloid positive regions of the hippocampus, EC, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe. Participants underwent 3 separate FUS treatment sessions performed 2 weeks apart. Outcome assessments included safety, imaging, neurological, cognitive, and florbetaben &#946;-amyloid PET. Ten participants (range 55-76 years old) completed 30 separate FUS treatments at 2 participating institutions, with 6-12 months of follow-up. All participants had immediate BBB opening after FUS and BBB closure within 24-48 hours. All FUS treatments were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the procedure. All 10 participants had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up, and 7 participants had a follow-up out to 1 year. Changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were comparable to those in controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. PET scans demonstrated an average &#946;-amyloid plaque of 14% in the Centiloid scale in the FUS-treated regions. This study is the largest cohort of participants with mild AD who received FUS treatment, and has the longest follow-up to date. Safety was demonstrated in conjunction with reversible and repeated BBB opening in multiple cortical and deep brain locations, with a concomitant reduction of &#946;-amyloid. There was no apparent cognitive worsening beyond expectations up to 1 year after FUS treatment, suggesting that the BBB opening treatment in multiple brain regions did not adversely influence AD progression.

The case of folic acid fortification (FAF) of staple foods for the prevention of spina bifida and anencephaly (SBA) represents an example of a new neurosurgical paradigm focused on public health intervention in addition to the treatment of individual cases. The Global Alliance for the Prevention of Spina Bifida-F (GAPSBiF), a multidisciplinary coalition of neurosurgeons, pediatricians, geneticists, epidemiologists, food scientists, and fortification policy experts, was formed to advocate for FAF of staple foods worldwide. This paper serves as a review of the work of GAPSBiF thus far in advocating for universal FAF of commonly consumed staple foods to equitably prevent SBA caused by folic acid insufficiency. A narrative review was performed using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. In this review, the authors describe the impact of SBA on patients, caregivers, and health systems, as well as characterize the multifaceted requirements for proper spina bifida care, including multidisciplinary clinics and the transition of care, while highlighting the role of neurosurgeons. Then they discuss prevention policy approaches, including supplementation, fortification, and hybrid efforts with folic acid. Next, they use the example of FAF of staple foods as a model for neurosurgeons' involvement in global public health through clinical practice, research, education and training, and advocacy. Last, they describe mechanisms for involvement in the above initiatives as a potential academic tenure track, including institutional partnerships, organized neurosurgery, neurosurgical expert groups, nongovernmental organizations, national or international governments, and multidisciplinary coalitions. The role of neurosurgeons in caring for children with spina bifida extends beyond treating patients in clinical practice and includes research, education and training, and advocacy initiatives to promote context-specific, evidence-based initiatives to public health problems.

By contrast, Trem2 functions can exacerbate tissue damage during respiratory viral or liver infections. We, therefore, investigated the role of Trem2 in a viral encephalomyelitis model associated with prominent Th1 mediated antiviral immunity leading to demyelination. Wild-type (WT) and Trem2 deficient (Trem2-/-) mice were infected with a sublethal glia tropic murine coronavirus (MHV-JHM) intracranially. Disease progression and survival were monitored daily. Leukocyte accumulation and pathological features including demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cords (SC) were determined by flow cytometry and tissue section immunofluorescence analysis. Expression of select inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was measured by RT-PCR and global myeloid cell gene expression in SC-derived microglia and infiltrated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were determined using the Nanostring nCounter platform. BMDM recruited to SCs in response to infection highly upregulated Trem2 mRNA compared to microglia coincident with viral control. Trem2 deficiency did not alter disease onset or severity, but impaired clinical recovery after onset of demyelination. Disease progression in Trem2-/- mice could not be attributed to altered virus control or an elevated proinflammatory response. A prominent difference was increased degenerated myelin not associated with the myeloid cell markers IBA1 and/or CD68. Gene expression profiles of SC-derived microglia and BMDM further revealed that Trem2 deficiency resulted in impaired upregulation of phagocytosis associated genes Lpl and Cd36 in microglia, but a more complex pattern in BMDM. Trem2 deficiency during viral-induced demyelination dysregulates expression of other select genes regulating phagocytic pathways and lipid metabolism, with distinct effects on microglia and BMDM. The ultimate failure to remove damaged myelin is reminiscent of toxin or autoimmune cell-induced demyelination models and supports that Trem2 function is regulated by sensing tissue damage including a dysregulated lipid environment in very distinct inflammatory environments.", "query": "no_model"}, "36333755": {"ArticleTitle": "The Persian version of the psychological flexibility in sport scale: a psychometric study.", "AbstractText": "There is a growing body of research suggesting that psychological flexibility (PF) is an important psychological construct related to psychological health and human performance.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension commonly presents in obese women of childbearing age, being headache and papilledema the main clinical manifestations. Characteristic radiological findings consist of increased cerebrospinal fluid around the optic nerve, partially empty sella turcica and stenosis of the transverse sinuses. Transverse sinus stenting is a treatment alternative that has proven valuable utility in the recent years. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension in most of cases presents with orthostatic headache and has predilection for female population.

We found correlations between m-ratios in visuomotor and motor tasks, but no correlations between m-ratios in visual and visuomotor tasks, or between motor and memory tasks.

Since several studies suggest a significant genetic contribution to the chronic use of many addictive drugs, the effect of MSCs secretome on morphine self-administration was further studied in rats bred as high alcohol consumers (UChB rats). Sub-chronic intraperitoneal administration of morphine before access to increasing concentrations of morphine solutions and water were available to the animals, led UChB rats to prefer ingesting morphine solutions over water, attaining levels of oral morphine intake in the range of those in the Wistar model. Intranasally administered MSCs secretome to UChB rats dose-dependently inhibited morphine self-administration by 72% (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001); while a single intranasal dose of MSC-secretome administered during a morphine deprivation period imposed on chronic morphine consumer UChB rats inhibited re-access morphine relapse intake by 80 to 85% (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001). Both in the Wistar and the UChB rat models, MSCs-secretome administration reversed the morphine-induced increases in brain oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, considered as key engines perpetuating drug relapse.

Using human cross-sectional and longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive assessment data, we show that in early stages of AD, increased concentration of soluble CSF p-tau is strongly associated with accumulation of insoluble tau aggregates across the brain, and CSF p-tau levels mediate the effect of A&#946; on tau aggregation. Further, higher soluble p-tau concentrations are mainly related to faster accumulation of tau aggregates in the regions with strong functional connectivity to individual tau epicenters. In this early stage, higher soluble p-tau concentrations is associated with cognitive decline, which is mediated by faster increase of tau aggregates. In contrast, in AD dementia, when A&#946; fibrils and soluble p-tau levels have plateaued, cognitive decline is related to the accumulation rate of insoluble tau aggregates.

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, they have been implicated in degenerative and regenerative processes. The discovery of distinct activation patterns, including increased phagocytosis, indicated a damaging role of myeloid cells in multiple system atrophy (MSA), a devastating, rapidly progressing atypical parkinsonian disorder. Here, we analyzed the gene expression profile of microglia in a mouse model of MSA (MBP29-h&#945;-syn) and identified a disease-associated expression profile and upregulation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (Csf1). Thus, we hypothesized that CSF1 receptor-mediated depletion of myeloid cells using PLX5622 modifies the disease progression and neuropathological phenotype in this mouse model. Intriguingly, sex-balanced analysis of myeloid cell depletion in MBP29-h&#945;-syn mice revealed a two-faced outcome comprising an improved survival rate accompanied by a delayed onset of neurological symptoms in contrast to severely impaired motor functions. Furthermore, PLX5622 reversed gene expression profiles related to myeloid cell activation but reduced gene expression associated with transsynaptic signaling and signal release. While transcriptional changes were accompanied by a reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, striatal neuritic density was increased upon myeloid cell depletion in MBP29-h&#945;-syn mice. Together, our findings provide insight into the complex, two-faced role of myeloid cells in the context of MSA emphasizing the importance to carefully balance the beneficial and adverse effects of CSF1R inhibition in different models of neurodegenerative disorders before its clinical translation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Myeloid cells have been implicated as detrimental in the disease pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy. However, long-term CSF1R-dependent depletion of these cells in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy demonstrates a two-faced effect involving an improved survival associated with a delayed onset of disease and reduced inflammation which was contrasted by severely impaired motor functions, synaptic signaling, and neuronal circuitries.

Within this study we investigated the association between omental (oWAT) and subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) with brain structure, perfusion and cognition in adults with severe obesity. Within the cross-sectional BARICO study, brain structure, perfusion and cognitive function were measured before bariatric surgery (BS) using MRI and cognitive assessments. During BS, oWAT and scWAT depots were collected and analyzed by histopathology. Number and diameter of adipocytes were quantified together with amount of crown-like structures (CLS) as indication of inflammation. Blood samples were collected to analyze adipokines and inflammatory markers. Neuroimaging outcomes included brain volumes, cortical thickness, white matter (WM) integrity, WM hyperintensities, cerebral blood flow using arterial spin labeling (ASL) and the ASL spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV), reflecting cerebrovascular health. 71 patients were included (mean age 45.1&#177;5.8 years; 83.1% women; mean BMI 40.8&#177;3.8). scWAT showed more CLS (Z=-2.72, p<0.01, r=-0.24) and hypertrophy compared to oWAT (F(1,64)=3.99, p<0.05, &#951;2=0.06).

In particular, the nitration of Gua, although detected, as well as its reaction kinetics have been seldom investigated. Thus, we studied the concentration- and temperature-dependent formation of 8-nitroguanine (8-NitroGua) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.40) using stopped-flow spectrophotometry.

Recent studies point to the association between an inflammatory phenotype and certain clinical symptoms in patients with depression. The objective of our study was to classify major depression disorder patients using supervised learning algorithms or machine learning, based on immunometabolic and oxidative stress biomarkers and lifestyle habits. Taking into account a series of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and glutathione), metabolic risk markers (blood pressure, waist circumference and glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels) and lifestyle habits of the participants (physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption), a study was carried out using machine learning in a sample of 171 participants, 91 patients with depression (71.42% women, mean age&#160;=&#160;50.64) and 80 healthy subjects (67.50% women, mean age&#160;=&#160;49.12). The algorithm used was the support vector machine, performing cross validation, by which the subdivision of the sample in training (70%) and test (30%) was carried out in order to estimate the precision of the model. The prediction of belonging to the patient group (MDD patients versus control subjects), melancholic type (melancholic versus non-melancholic patients) or resistant depression group (treatment-resistant versus non-treatment-resistant) was based on the importance of each of the immunometabolic and lifestyle variables. With the application of the algorithm, controls versus patients, such as patients with melancholic symptoms versus non-melancholic symptoms, and resistant versus non-resistant symptoms in the test phase were optimally classified. The variables that showed greater importance, according to the results of the area under the ROC curve, for the discrimination between healthy subjects and patients with depression were current alcohol consumption (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.62), TNF-&#945; levels (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.61), glutathione redox status (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.60) and the performance of both moderate (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.59) and vigorous physical exercise (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.58). On the other hand, the most important variables for classifying melancholic patients in relation to lifestyle habits were past (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.65) and current (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.60) tobacco habit, as well as walking routinely (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.59) and in relation to immunometabolic markers were the levels of CRP (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.62) and glucose (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.58). In the analysis of the importance of the variables for the classification of treatment-resistant patients versus non-resistant patients, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) variable was shown to be the most relevant (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.67). Other immunometabolic variables were also among the most important such as TNF-&#945; (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.65) and waist circumference (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.64). In this case, sex (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.59) was also relevant along with alcohol (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.58) and tobacco (AUC&#160;=&#160;0.56) consumption. The results obtained in our study show that it is possible to predict the diagnosis of depression and its clinical typology from immunometabolic markers and lifestyle habits, using machine learning techniques.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been advocated in the management of different conditions, including BD, especially in treatment-resistant cases. The optimal dose and timing of tDCS, the mutual influence with other concurrently administered interventions, long-term efficacy, overall safety, and biological underpinnings nonetheless deserve additional assessment. The present study appraised the existing clinical evidence about tDCS for bipolar depression, delving into the putative biological underpinnings with a special emphasis on cellular and molecular levels, with the ultimate goal of providing a translational perspective on the matter. Two separate systematic reviews across the PubMed database since inception up to August 8th 2022 were performed, with fourteen clinical and nineteen neurobiological eligible studies. The included clinical studies encompass 207 bipolar depression patients overall and consistently document the efficacy of tDCS, with a reduction in depression scores after treatment ranging from 18% to 92%. The RCT with the largest sample clearly showed a significant superiority of active stimulation over sham. Mild-to-moderate and transient adverse effects are attributed to tDCS across these studies. The review of neurobiological literature indicates that several molecular mechanisms may account for the antidepressant effect of tDCS in BD patients, including the action on calcium homeostasis in glial cells, the enhancement of LTP, the regulation of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory mediators, and the modulation of the expression of plasticity-related genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the matter to concurrently provide a synthesis of the clinical evidence and an in-depth appraisal of the putative biological underpinnings, providing consistent support for the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tDCS.", "query": "no_model"}, "36332697": {"ArticleTitle": "Age-related differences in Default Mode Network resting-state functional connectivity but not gray matter volume relate to sacrificial moral decision-making and working memory performance.", "AbstractText": "Older adults make fewer utilitarian decisions than younger adults during sacrificial moral dilemmas, which are associated with age-related reductions in Default Mode Network resting-state functional connectivity.

Age-related changes in structure and function of the Default Mode Network may be associated with poorer working memory capacity and reduced utilitarian moral decision-making. Alternatively, recent theories suggest that age-related changes to Default Mode Network function may be adaptive in the context of tasks that include socioemotional components. As such, reduced within-network resting-state functional connectivity of the Default Mode Network may be associated with differential outcomes in moral decision-making for younger and older adults. In the present study, there were no age-related differences in working memory capacity. Older adults were less likely than younger adults to indicate the utilitarian option when trials involved Instrumental harm. Generally, increased within-network resting-state functional connectivity of the Default Mode Network was associated with better working memory performance in both groups, and reduced bias to endorse the utilitarian option during Incidental dilemmas compared to Instrumental dilemmas in younger adults. Older adults with similar moral decision-making behavior to younger adults demonstrated increased coupling between Default Mode Network and Salience Network regions.

Both regions differ considerably in their glial cell population but are supplied by the posterior circulation. CHIT1 and CHI3L1 expression was compared to changes in microglial (IBA1, CD68), astrocytic (GFAP, S100&#946;), and neuronal markers (H&E, neurofilament heavy chain, NfH; calretinin, CALR) using immunohistochemistry and multiple-label immunofluorescence. Initial striatal cortical and cerebellar Purkinje cell damage, detectable already 1/2 d after HIBI, led to delayed neuronal death, whereas loss of cerebellar NfH-positive stellate and CALR-positive granule cells was variable. During the first week post-HIBI, a transient reduction of IBA1-positive microglia was observed in both regions, and fragmented/clasmatodendritic cerebellar Bergmann glia appeared. In long-term survivors, both brain regions displayed high densities of activated IBA1-positive cells and CD68-positive macrophages, which showed CHIT1 co-localization in the striate cortex. Furthermore, enlarged GFAP- and S100&#946;-positive astroglia emerged in both regions around 9-10 d post-HIBI, i.e., along with clearance of dead neurons from the neuropil, although GFAP-/S100&#946;-positive gemistocytic astrocytes that co-expressed CHI3L1 were found only in the striate cortex. Thus, only GFAP-/S100&#946;-positive astrocytes in the striate cortex, but not cerebellar Bergmann glia, differentiated into CHI3L1-positive gemistocytes.

A small quantifiable volume dubbed the compensatory reserve volume (CRV) permits energy transmission to brain tissue during acceleration/deceleration events. The CRV is principally regulated by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CBF is primarily determined by the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide (CO2). We hypothesized that experimental hypercapnia (i.e. increased inspired concentration of CO2) may act to prevent and mitigate the actions of acceleration/deceleration-induced TBI. To determine these effects C57Bl/6 mice underwent experimental hypercapnia whereby they were exposed to medical-grade atmospheric air or 5% CO2 immediately prior to an acceleration/deceleration-induced mTBI paradigm. mTBI results in significant increases in righting reflex time (RRT), reductions in core body temperature, and reductions in general locomotor activity three hours post injury (hpi). Experimental hypercapnia immediately preceding mTBI was found to prevent mTBI-induced increases in RRT and reductions in core body temperature and general locomotor activity. RNA sequencing conducted four hpi revealed that CO2 exposure prevented mTBI-induced transcriptional alterations of several targets related to oxidative stress, immune, and inflammatory signaling. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed the prevention of mTBI-induced increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 6 and metallothionein-2.

However, the correspondence between the timing and spatial localization of changes in neural activity following targeted WM training has not been well-established. To address this, we used an event-related potential (ERP) source localization approach to identify the patterns of cortical activity changes that are induced by WM training along both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Healthy adult participants completed approximately 20 sessions of training on either a WM training protocol (visual-letter n-back task), or a control training protocol (visual-letter search task). ERP measures were obtained before and after training (pretest and posttest) for a letter 3-back task. A beamformer source localization method was applied to the ERP data in the N2 (approximately 200-350 msec post-stimulus) and P3 (approximately 300-600 msec post-stimulus) component time windows to identify the cortical activity associated with WM training at distinct stages of information processing. Pretest-to-posttest cortical activity changes that corresponded with WM training gains were observed within the N2 time window, but not the P3 time window. Within the WM training group, training-related enhancement of N2 source activity in bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, left rostral anterior cingulate, and right posterior cingulate cortex was significantly associated with behavioral performance improvements on the trained task and untrained tasks of WM.

Greater error-related theta is thought to reflect an error detection signal, while delta activity may reflect more elaborative post-detection processes (i.e., strategic adjustments).

Of the 80 bipolar offspring entering the analysis, the FCs between left hippocampus and left precuneus, and between right hippocampus and left posterior cingulate, showed a discriminative capacity for predicting future mood disorder (area-under-curve, or AUC=75.76 % and 75.00 % respectively), and for predicting BD onset (AUC=77.46 % and 81.63 %, respectively).

We hypothesized that many contradictions arise from two commonly-held assumptions about computational model parameters that are actually often invalid: That parameters <i>generalize</i> between contexts (e.g. tasks, models) and that they capture <i>interpretable</i> (i.e. unique, distinctive) neurocognitive processes. To test this, we asked 291 participants aged 8-30 years to complete three learning tasks in one experimental session, and fitted RL models to each.

The class II member HDAC4, which recently emerged as a crucial factor in shaping synaptic plasticity and memory, was found to be altered in AD. We investigated how the modulation of HDAC4 may contribute to counteracting AD pathogenesis. Using a cytoplasmic HDAC4 mutant (HDAC4SD ) we studied the recovery of synaptic function in hippocampal tissue and primary neurons from the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3&#215;Tg-AD). Here we report that in wild-type mice, HDAC4 is localized at synapses and interacts with post-synaptic proteins while in the 3&#215;Tg-AD it undergoes nuclear import, reducing its interaction with synaptic proteins. Of note, HDAC4 delocalization was induced by both amyloid-&#946; and tau accumulation. Overexpression of the HDAC4SD mutant in CA1 pyramidal neurons of organotypic hippocampal slices obtained from 3&#215;Tg-AD mice increased dendritic length and promoted the enrichment of N-Cad, GluA1, PSD95 and CaMKII proteins at the synaptic level compared with AD neurons transfected with the empty vector. Moreover, HDAC4 overexpression recovered the level of SUMO2-3ylation of PSD95 in AD hippocampal tissue, and in AD organotypic hippocampal slices the HDAC4SD rescued spine density and synaptic transmission.

We reviewed clinical data from all patients with autopsy data seen in the Movement Disorders Center at Washington University, St. Louis between 1996 and 2019. All patients with a diagnosis of PD based on neuropathology were included. We used logistic regression and MANCOVA to investigate the relationship between neuropathology and dementia. A total of 165 PD patients met inclusion criteria. Among these, 128 had clinical dementia. Those with dementia had greater mean ages of motor onset and death but equivalent mean disease duration. The delay between motor symptom onset and dementia was one year or less in 14 individuals, meeting research diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Braak Lewy body stage was associated with diagnosis of dementia, whereas severities of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and small vessel pathology did not. Pathology of individuals diagnosed with DLB did not differ significantly from that of other PD patients with dementia. 6% of individuals with PD and dementia did not have neocortical Lewy bodies; 68% with PD but without dementia did have neocortical Lewy bodies. Neocortical Lewy bodies almost always accompany dementia in PD; however, they also appear in most PD patients without dementia. In some cases, dementia may occur in PD patients without neocortical Lewy bodies, ADNC, or small vessel disease. Thus, other factors not directly related to these classic neuropathologic features may contribute to PD dementia. This article is protected by copyright.

However, it is unknown whether eccentricity affects early neuronal electrophysiological responses to fear-conditioned stimuli. We examined early event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to fear-conditioned faces to address this question. Participants (N&#160;=&#160;80) were presented with faces, either paired with an aversive (CS+) or neutral sound (CS-), at central or peripheral positions. We ensured constant central fixation using online eye-tracking but directed attention to either centrally or peripherally presented faces. Manipulation checks showed successful fear-conditioning (i.e., on average lower ratings in valence and higher ratings in arousal and perceived threat) and successful shifts of visuospatial attention indexed by high task performance and pre-stimulus alpha lateralization of the EEG spectra. We observed a generally increased P1 to fear-conditioned faces regardless of presentation location. An N170 difference between fear-conditioned and neutral stimuli was found but was restricted to the central location and depended on the effectivity of fear-conditioning. A similar effect was observed for the early posterior negativity (EPN). Trait anxiety was not related to differential ERP responses to CS+ versus CS- faces for any ERP component. These findings suggest that the P1 indexes early responses to centrally and peripherally presented fear-conditioned faces. Subsequent stages are modulated by the spatial location of the stimuli. This suggests different stages of neural processing of fear-conditioned faces depending on their spatial location. Finally, our results question the hypothesis that trait anxiety in healthy participants is related to altered visual processing of fear-conditioned faces.", "query": "no_model"}, "36331147": {"ArticleTitle": "Influence of signal-to-noise ratio, glaucoma stage and segmentation algorithm on OCT usability for quantifying layer thicknesses in the peripapillary retina.", "AbstractText": "OCT can be used for glaucoma assessment, but its usefulness may depend on image quality, disease stage and segmentation algorithm.

All participants completed three tests of explicit motor imagery, a mental rotation test and a test of visuospatial perspective-taking. Patients with anorexia nervosa, with respect to controls, reported greater difficulties in imagining movements according to a first-person perspective, lower accuracy in motor imagery, selective impairment in the mental rotation of human figures, and reduced ability in assuming a different egocentric visuospatial perspective.

The characterization of spinal cord lesions in terms of longitudinal extension, location on axial plane, involvement of the white matter and/or gray matter, and specific patterns of contrast enhancement, often allows a proper differentiation of these diseases. For instance, besides classical features, such as the presence of longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions in patients with aquaporin-4-IgG positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4+NMOSD), novel radiological signs (e.g., H sign, trident sign) have been recently proposed and successfully applied for the differential diagnosis of inflammatory myelopathies. In this review article, we will discuss the radiological features of spinal cord involvement in autoimmune disorders such as MS, AQP4+NMOSD, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), and other recently characterized immune-mediated diseases. The identification of imaging pitfalls and mimics that can lead to misdiagnosis will also be examined. Since spinal cord damage is a major cause of irreversible clinical disability, the recognition of these radiological aspects will help clinicians achieve a correct and prompt diagnosis, treat early with disease-specific treatment and improve patient outcomes.", "query": "no_model"}, "36330348": {"ArticleTitle": "Brain white matter hyperintensities in Kawasaki disease: A case-control study.", "AbstractText": "Cerebrovascular involvement of Kawasaki disease (KD) is poorly studied.

In this case-control study, patients diagnosed with KD (cases) at our tertiary hospital between 1978 and 1995 were invited to brain magnetic resonance (MRI) between 2016 and 2017. Migraine patients (controls) with available brain MRI were matched with cases (ratio 4:1) by age (&#177;2 years) and sex. Two blinded neuroradiologists evaluated independently cerebrovascular findings from the brain MRI scans. Modified Scheltens' visual rating scale was used to evaluate WMH burden and the total WMH volume was measured using manual segmentation. Mean age [years, (SD)] at the time of brain MRI was 33.3 (3.8) and 32.8 (4.0) for cases (n = 40) and controls (n = 160), respectively (P = 0.53). Mean follow-up time for cases was 29.5 years (4.3). Total volume of WMHs (median) was 0.26 cm3 (IQR 0.34) for cases and 0.065 cm3 (IQR 0.075) for controls, P = 0.039.

Considerable research has gone into understanding AD; however, there is still a lack of effective biomarkers that aid in early diagnosis and intervention. The recent discovery of the glymphatic system and associated Perivascular Spaces (PVS) has led to the theory that enlarged PVS (ePVS) may be an indicator of AD progression and act as an early diagnostic marker. Visible on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), PVS appear to enlarge when known biomarkers of AD, amyloid-&#946; and tau, accumulate. The central goal of ePVS and AD research is to determine when ePVS occurs in AD progression and if ePVS are causal or epiphenomena. Furthermore, if ePVS are indeed causative, interventions promoting glymphatic clearance are an attractive target for research. However, it is necessary first to ascertain where on the pathological progression of AD ePVS occurs. This review aims to examine the knowledge gap that exists in understanding the contribution of ePVS to AD. It is essential to understand whether ePVS in the brain correlate with increased regional tau distribution and global or regional Amyloid-&#946; distribution and to determine if these spaces increase proportionally over time as individuals experience neurodegeneration. This review demonstrates that ePVS are associated with reduced glymphatic clearance and that this reduced clearance is associated with an increase in amyloid-&#946;. However, it is not yet understood if ePVS are the outcome or driver of protein accumulation. Further, it is not yet clear if ePVS volume and number change longitudinally. Ultimately, it is vital to determine early diagnostic criteria and early interventions for AD to ease the burden it presents to the world; ePVS may be able to fulfill this role and therefore merit further research.", "query": "no_model"}, "36330344": {"ArticleTitle": "Editorial: In vivo investigations on neurological disorders: From traditional approaches to forefront technologies.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36330282": {"ArticleTitle": "The role of massive demographic databases in intractable illnesses: Denomics for dementia.", "AbstractText": "Despite intensive research, effective treatments for many common and devastating diseases are lacking.

The objective of this study was to investigate associations of BMI and sarcopenia with mild cognitive impairment in Colombia. Data were from the National Survey of Health, Wellbeing and Aging in Colombia (SABE Colombia, in Spanish). Community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older were invited to participate. Trained interviewers administered a shorter version of the mini-mental state examination and mild cognitive impairment was defined as a score of 12 or less out of 19. Body mass index was defined using standard cut-offs. Sarcopenia was defined as low grip strength or slow chair stands. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, height, education, income, civil status, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment was 20% in 23,694 participants in SABE Colombia and 17% in 5,760 participants in the sub-sample in which sarcopenia was assessed. Overweight and obesity were associated with decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment and sarcopenia was associated with increased risk. Sarcopenia was a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment in those with normal BMI (adjusted model included 4,911 men and women). Compared with those with normal BMI and without sarcopenia, the odds ratio for mild cognitive impairment was 1.84 in those with normal BMI and sarcopenia (95% confidence interval: 1.25, 2.71). Sarcopenia was also a risk factor in those with obesity but did not present a greater risk than sarcopenia alone. Compared with those with normal BMI and without sarcopenia, the odds ratio was 1.62 in those with obesity and sarcopenia (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.48). Sarcopenia was not a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment in those with overweight. Similar results were observed when reference values from Colombia were used to set cut-offs for grip strength. Similar results were also observed in cross-validation models, which suggests the results are robust.

Our results showed that native PLGA can not only suppress the spontaneous aggregation but can also trigger disassembly of preformed A&#946; aggregates.

Problems and pitfalls in translational neuroscience-a 40-year experience.", "AbstractText": "Translational research in behavioral neuroscience seeks causes and remedies for human mental health problems in animals, following leads imposed by clinical research in psychiatry. This endeavor faces several problems because scientists must read and interpret animal movements to represent human perceptions, mood, and memory processes. Yet, it is still not known how mammalian brains bundle all these processes into a highly compressed motor output in the brain stem and spinal cord, but without that knowledge, translational research remains aimless. Based on some four decades of experience in the field, the article identifies sources of interpretation problems and illustrates typical translational pitfalls. (1) The sensory world of mice is different. Smell, hearing, and tactile whisker sensations dominate in rodents, while visual input is comparatively small. In humans, the relations are reversed. (2) Mouse and human brains are equated inappropriately: the association cortex makes up a large portion of the human neocortex, while it is relatively small in rodents. The predominant associative cortex in rodents is the hippocampus itself, orchestrating chiefly inputs from secondary sensorimotor areas and generating species-typical motor patterns that are not easily reconciled with putative human hippocampal functions. (3) Translational interpretation of studies of memory or emotionality often neglects the ecology of mice, an extremely small species surviving by freezing or flight reactions that do not need much cognitive processing. (4) Further misinterpretations arise from confounding neuronal properties with system properties, and from rigid mechanistic thinking unaware that many experimentally induced changes in the brain do partially reflect unpredictable compensatory plasticity. (5) Based on observing hippocampal lesion effects in mice indoors and outdoors, the article offers a simplistic general model of hippocampal functions in relation to hypothalamic input and output, placing hypothalamus and the supraspinal motor system at the top of a cerebral hierarchy. (6) Many translational problems could be avoided by inclusion of simple species-typical behaviors as end-points comparable to human cognitive or executive processing, and to rely more on artificial intelligence for recognizing patterns not classifiable by traditional psychological concepts.", "query": "no_model"}, "36330048": {"ArticleTitle": "The rough-and-tumble play of rats as a natural behavior suitable for studying the social brain.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36330046": {"ArticleTitle": "How to improve the diet of toddlers?

Although several studies have examined functional activation and connectivity in long-term as well as short-term meditators from different meditation traditions, it is unclear if long-term meditation practice brings about distinct changes in network properties of brain functional connectivity that persist during task performance. Indeed, task-based functional connectivity studies of meditators are rare. This study aimed to differentiate between long-term and short-term Rajayoga meditators based on functional connectivity between regions of interest in the brain. Task-based fMRI was captured as the meditators performed an engaging task. The graph theoretical-based functional connectivity measures of task-based fMRI were calculated using CONN toolbox and were used as features to classify the two groups using Machine Learning models. In this study, we recruited two age and sex-matched groups of Rajayoga meditators from the Brahma Kumaris tradition that differed in the duration of their meditation experience: Long-term practitioners (n = 12, mean 13,596 h) and short-term practitioners (n = 10, mean 1095 h). fMRI data were acquired as they performed an engaging task and functional connectivity metrics were calculated from this data. These metrics were used as features in training machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we used adjacency matrices generated from graph measures, global efficiency, and local efficiency, as features. We computed functional connectivity with 132 ROIs as well as 32 network ROIs. Five machine learning models, such as logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted tree, were trained to classify the two groups. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity, area under the curve receiver operating characteristics curve were used as performance measures.

The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), an Institute of National Importance and a tertiary mental and neurological healthcare hospital situated in Bengaluru, India, has established one such integrative model. The present manuscript traces the history and describes the important steps followed in this integrative approach. The NIMHANS model followed a stage-wise two-step approach: (1) First stage - Starting with Integration of Yoga: The process began more than a decade ago, with integrating yoga into a clinical department (rather than an exclusive research-based approach) of the institute which had relatively high clinical service load (For example, Department of Psychiatry in NIMHANS). Yoga was gradually formalized into academic and clinical activities (outpatient and inpatient services) by appointing a Yoga faculty with a medical background with an MD/PhD in Yoga. The research was primarily directed by the clinical observations of patients receiving yoga therapy. (2) Second stage: Adding an appropriate and compatible discipline from Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) system (Ayurveda in this case): The center for yoga gradually evolved into the Department of Integrative Medicine with the appointment of faculty from the Ayurveda stream. In this model, specialists from each discipline provide clinical inputs after simultaneous consultation with the patient through systemic integration in clinical, academic, and research domains rather than mere co-location of AYUSH services with mainstream medicine. The NIMHANS model of integration suggests the application of yoga into mainstream clinical service as the first step toward integration. Yoga should be added as a formalized clinical discipline with systemic integration. Gradually, other feasible systems of traditional medicine from AYUSH can be integrated at a later stage in a step-by-step manner based on clinical practice and evidence.", "query": "no_model"}, "36329769": {"ArticleTitle": "Effect of Yoga on Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Spinal Mobility in Computer Users with Chronic Low Back Pain.", "AbstractText": "Office workers who need to use a computer while maintaining a static position for prolonged periods have more chance of having low back pain (LBP).

Sound therapy, including provision of hearing aids may be offered, but this is often dependent on a clinician's decision rather than UK policy. This inconsistent management reflects a lack of evidence around the effectiveness of hearing aids for tinnitus. This open-label, two-arm multicentre randomised controlled feasibility trial gathered data around recruitment, acceptability and outcome assessments to determine the feasibility of conducting a large randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of hearing aids for tinnitus management. Adults referred to audiology for tinnitus, with an aidable hearing loss were recruited at five UK audiology clinics.

Eighty three participants from five sites were randomised. Non-aidable hearing loss was the main reason for ineligibility to participate in the trial reported by the sites. Seventy three percent of participants returned the 12-week questionnaires, with return rates by site ranging from 61 to 100%. Fifteen out of 33 participants (45%) reported using hearing aids for the clinician-recommended time, or longer, during the day. The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was the outcome measure most responsive to change. The majority of participants also agreed it was relevant to their tinnitus and hearing loss. Qualitative data demonstrated that the trial was acceptable to participants. Feedback from clinicians revealed a potential lack of equipoise. It also highlighted the differences in referral and treatment pathways between departments and differences in audiometric criteria for fitting hearing aids. Health economic measures were well completed for those returned. No change in health-related quality of life was observed. Costs were higher in the intervention arm, but self-reports of healthcare service use indicated participant confusion in treatment pathways. This feasibility trial is the first step towards obtaining high quality evidence to determine potential clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of hearing aids for tinnitus versus usual care.

The two forms are well defined in the northern part of the species distribution, where autogeny is strictly associated with the molestus form. However, whether the two remain distinct and show the characteristic differences in behavior is less clear in North Africa, at the southern edge of their range. The association between autogeny, as determined by ovarian dissection, and molecular forms, based on the CQ11 microsatellite marker, was studied in six Moroccan populations of C. pipiens. An overall low prevalence of autogeny was found at three of the Moroccan regions studied, although it reached 17.5% in the Agadir population. The prevalence of form-specific CQ11 alleles was quite similar across all populations, with the molestus allele being rarer (approx. 15%), except in the Agadir population where it reached 43.3%. We found significant deficits in heterozygotes at the diagnostic CQ11 locus in three populations, but the three other populations showed no significant departure from panmixia, which is in line with the results of a retrospective analysis of the published data. More importantly, we found no association between the autogeny status and CQ11 genotypes, despite the many females analyzed. There was limited evidence for two discrete forms in Morocco, where individuals carrying pipiens and molestus alleles breed and mate in the same sites and are equally likely to be capable of autogeny.

As 18&#160;kDa translocator protein (TSPO) was previously reported to be associated with aggressive histopathological glioma features, we correlated the TSPO positron emission tomography (PET) signal using [18F]GE180 in a large cohort of recurrent glioma patients with their clinical outcome. In patients with [18F]GE180 PET at glioma recurrence, [18F]GE180 PET parameters (e.g., SUVmax) as well as other imaging features (e.g., MRI volume, [18F]FET PET parameters when available) were evaluated together with patient characteristics (age, sex, Karnofsky-Performance score) and neuropathological features (e.g. WHO 2021 grade, IDH-mutation status). Uni- and multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for post-recurrence survival (PRS) and time to treatment failure (TTF). Eighty-eight consecutive patients were evaluated. TSPO tracer uptake correlated with tumor grade at recurrence (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05), with no significant differences in IDH-wild-type versus IDH-mutant tumors.

By investigating the properties of this landscape in individuals in different states of consciousness, we show that consciousness is associated with short term transitions that are less predictable, quicker, but, on average, more constant. We also show that temporally-specific connectivity states are less easily describable by network patterns that are distant in time, suggesting a richer space of possible states.

To determine whether N/OFQ signaling contributes to the changes in both behavior phenotypes and RMTg activity of alcohol withdrawn (Post-EtOH) rats, we trained adult male Long-Evans rats, randomly assigned into the ethanol and Na&#239;ve groups to consume either 20% ethanol or water-only under an intermittent-access procedure.

However, when faced with harsh environmental conditions, certain mammalian species enter torpor, a state characterized by reduced metabolism, body temperature, and activity, to minimize energy loss. Etruscan shrews are the smallest mammals, with a surface-to-volume ratio that is very unfavorable for endothermic animals. As a result, Etruscan shrews have an extremely high metabolic rate and are known to enter torpor frequently, presumably as an energy-saving measure. Despite the recent identification of medial preoptic area (MPA) as a key brain region to regulate torpor in mouse, little is known about neural control of torpor in other endothermic animals, including the Etruscan shrew. Here, we confirmed that Etruscan shrews readily enter torpor even in the absence of strong physiological triggers. We then compared the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) within the MPA of Etruscan shrew and rat, a mammal that does not enter torpor under physiological conditions. While rats have roughly 100 times the body weight and 33 times the brain weight of Etruscan shrews, we find that the male rat MPN exhibits only 6.7 times the volume of that of the male Etruscan shrew. Accordingly, the relative brain volume of the MPN was 6.5-fold larger in shrews, a highly significant difference. Moreover, MPN neuron counts were only roughly twofold lower in shrews than in rats, an astonishing observation considering the interspecies size difference and that neocortical neurons are&#8201;~&#8201;20&#8201;&#215;&#8201;more numerous in rats than in shrews.

These representations are active earlier when phonemes are more predictable, and are sustained longer when lexical identity is uncertain. Our results show how phonetic sequences in natural speech are represented at the level of populations of neurons, providing insight into what intermediary representations exist between the sensory input and sub-lexical units.

We performed two-sample inverse-variance-weighted MR using individual-level Breast Cancer Association Consortium case-control data from 130 957 European-ancestry women (69 838 invasive cases), and published UK Biobank data (n=91 105-377 234). Genetic instruments were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated in UK Biobank with wrist-worn accelerometer-measured overall physical activity (nsnps=5) or sedentary time (nsnps=6), or accelerometer-measured (nsnps=1) or self-reported (nsnps=5) vigorous physical activity. Greater genetically-predicted overall activity was associated with lower breast cancer overall risk (OR=0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.83 per-standard deviation (SD;~8 milligravities acceleration)) and for most case-groups. Genetically-predicted vigorous activity was associated with lower risk of pre/perimenopausal breast cancer (OR=0.62; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.87,&#8805;3 vs. 0 self-reported days/week), with consistent estimates for most case-groups. Greater genetically-predicted sedentary time was associated with higher hormone-receptor-negative tumour risk (OR=1.77; 95% CI 1.07 to 2.92 per-SD (~7% time spent sedentary)), with elevated estimates for most case-groups. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses examining pleiotropy (including weighted-median-MR, MR-Egger). Our study provides strong evidence that greater overall physical activity, greater vigorous activity, and lower sedentary time are likely to reduce breast cancer risk.

ABCD1 has a role in transporting very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA)-CoA into the peroxisome for &#946;-oxidation. ABCD1 dysfunction leads to reduced VLCFA &#946;-oxidation and in turn increased VLCFA levels in the plasma and the cells of all tissues; these increased plasma levels have been used to diagnose X-ALD. It has been reported that plasma VLCFA is not correlated with the severity and disease phenotype of X-ALD. Therefore, we cannot predict the disease progression by the plasma VLCFA level. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is constantly produced by brain, and thus levels of lipids containing VLCFA in CSF might be informative in terms of assessing X-ALD pathology.

Multi-echo data acquisition in combination with echo-time dependent ICA denoising (ME-ICA) represents one promising strategy to mitigate physiological and hardware-related noise sources as well as motion-related artifacts. However, most studies employing ME-ICA to date are resting-state fMRI studies, and therefore we have a limited understanding of the impact of ME-ICA on complex task or model-based fMRI paradigms. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by comparing data quality and model fitting performance of data acquired during a visual population receptive field (pRF) mapping (N&#160;=&#160;13 participants) experiment after applying one of three preprocessing procedures: ME-ICA, optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising, and typical single echo processing. As expected, multi-echo fMRI improved temporal signal-to-noise compared to single echo fMRI, with ME-ICA amplifying the improvement compared to optimal combination alone. However, unexpectedly, this boost in temporal signal-to-noise did not directly translate to improved model fitting performance: compared to single echo acquisition, model fitting was only improved after ICA-denoising. Specifically, compared to single echo acquisition, ME-ICA resulted in improved variance explained by our pRF model throughout the visual system, including anterior regions of the temporal and parietal lobes where SNR is typically low, while optimal combination without ICA did not. ME-ICA also improved reliability of parameter estimates compared to single echo and optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising.

Interestingly, tongue movements contain both unique as well as synergistic information with the envelope that are encoded in the listener's brain activity.

The vHC-NAc pathway was targeted by infusing CNO into the NAc (3 or 10 &#956;M/side) 30-min before testing. CNO activation of the pathway in mice expressing excitatory (hM3Dq) DREADDs selectively reduced consumption in CIE mice back to CTL levels (&#8764;35-45%; p<0.05) without affecting CTL alcohol intake. Lastly, activating the vHC-NAc pathway increased cFos expression and evoked significant glutamate release from the vHC terminals in the NAc. These data indicate that reduced activity of the vHC increases alcohol consumption and that targeted, increased activity of the vHC-NAc pathway attenuates excessive drinking associated with alcohol dependence. Thus, these findings indicate that the vHC and its glutamatergic projections to the NAc are involved in excessive alcohol drinking.", "query": "no_model"}, "36328163": {"ArticleTitle": "Intestinal Epithelial Stem Cell Transplants as a Novel Therapy for Cerebrovascular Stroke.", "AbstractText": "Almost 2/3rds of stroke survivors exhibit vascular cognitive impairment and a third of stroke patients will develop dementia 1-3 years after stroke.

We tested whether repairing the gut via intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) transplants would also improve stroke recovery.

Here, we investigated whether contextual information, that is not explicitly linked to the intrinsic object properties (e.g., size or weight) but is informative for motor control requirements, can mediate force scaling. For this, we relied on two separate behavioral tasks during which we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe corticospinal excitability (CSE), as a window onto the primary motor cortex role in controlling fingertip forces. In experiment 1, participants performed a force tracking task, where we manipulated available implicit and explicit visual information. That is, either the force target was fully visible, or only the force error was displayed as a deviation from a horizontal line. We found that participants' performance was better when the former condition, in which they had explicit access to predictive information. However, we did not find differences in CSE modulation based on the type of visual information. On the other hand, CSE was modulated by the change in muscle contraction, i.e., contraction vs. relaxation and fast vs. slow changes. In sum, these findings indicate that CSE only reflects the ongoing motor command. In experiment 2, other participants performed a sequential object lifting task of visually identical objects that were differently weighted, in a seemingly random order. Within this task, we hid short series of incrementally increasing object weights. This allowed us to investigate whether participants would scale their forces for specific object weights based on the previously lifted object (i.e., sensorimotor effect) or based on the implicit information about the hidden series of incrementally increasing weights (i.e., extrapolation beyond sensorimotor effects). Results showed that participants did not extrapolate fingertip forces based on the hidden series but scaled their forces solely on the previously lifted object. Unsurprisingly, CSE was not modulated differently when lifting series of random weights versus series of increasing weights. Altogether, these results in two different grasping tasks suggest that CSE encodes ongoing motor components but not sensorimotor cues that are hidden within contextual information.", "query": "no_model"}, "36328114": {"ArticleTitle": "Coronary angiography- or fractional flow reserve-guided complete revascularization in multivessel disease STEMI: A Bayesian hierarchical network meta-analysis.", "AbstractText": "To identify the best strategy to achieve complete revascularization (CR) in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multi-vessel disease (MVD).

The main objective of our study is to differentiate patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy from healthy controls by applying machine learning techniques on interictal electroencephalographic recordings. Our research predicts which patients have idiopathic generalized epilepsy from a scalp EEG study. In addition, this study focuses on using the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) method applied to scalp EEG. XGB is one of the variants of gradient boosting and is a supervised learning algorithm. This type of system is developed to increase performance and processing speed. Through this proposed method, an attempt is made to recognize patterns from scalp EEG recordings that would allow the detection of IGE with high accuracy and differentiate IGE patients from healthy controls, creating an additional tool to support clinicians in their decision-making. Among the ML methods applied, the proposed XGB method achieves a better prediction of the distinct features in EEG signals from patients with IGE. XGB was 6.26% more accurate than the k-Nearest Neighbours method and was more accurate than the support vector machine (10.61%), decision tree (9.71%) and Gaussian Na&#239;ve Bayes (11.83%).

In both groups, the interrupter evoked larger neural responses when it was to be attended compared to when it was irrelevant, including for the P3a \"reorienting\" response previously described as involuntary. This attentional modulation was weaker in ADHD listeners, even though their behavioral performance was the same.

This review highlights sex differences in context and cued fear conditioning, fear extinction and fear generalization with a focus on the neural circuits underlying these behaviors in rodents. There are mixed reports of behavioral sex differences in context and cued fear conditioning paradigms, which can depend upon the behavioral indices of fear. However, there is greater evidence of differential activation of the hippocampus, amygdalar nuclei and the prefrontal cortical regions in male and female rodents during context and cued fear conditioning. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a sexually dimorphic structure, is of particular interest as it differentially contributes to fear responses in males and females. In addition, while the influence of the estrous cycle on different phases of fear conditioning is delineated, the clearest modulatory effect of estrogen is on fear extinction processes.

However, different species exhibit strong spatial biases in how they use optic flow.

The performance associated with these biases, however, depends on interactions between the environment and the animal's brain and behavior. Using the larval zebrafish as a model, we recorded natural optic flow associated with swimming trajectories in the animal's habitat with an omnidirectional camera mounted on a mechanical arm. An analysis of these flow fields suggests that lateral regions of the lower visual field are most informative about swimming speed. This pattern is consistent with the recent findings that zebrafish optomotor responses are preferentially driven by optic flow in the lateral lower visual field, which we extend with behavioral results from a high-resolution spherical arena.

The defacing process must undergo quality control (QC) checks to ensure that the facial features have been removed and that the brain tissue is left intact. Visual QC checks are time-consuming and can cause delays in preparing data. We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can assist with the QC of the application of MRI defacing; our CNN is able to distinguish between scans that are correctly defaced and can classify defacing failures into three sub-types to facilitate parameter tuning during remedial re-defacing. Since integrating the CNN into our anonymisation pipeline, over 75,000 scans have been processed. Strict thresholds have been applied so that ambiguous classifications are referred for visual QC checks, however all scans still undergo an efficient verification check before being marked as passed. After applying the thresholds, our network is 92% accurate and can classify nearly half of the scans without the need for protracted manual checks. Our model can generalise across MRI modalities and has comparable performance when tested on an independent dataset.

The study included 60 participants, 29 PD and 31 HC participants whom performed a digital CDT (DCTclock) in conjunction with a Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) system measuring neural activation in the PFC. HbO2 signals derived from the fNIRS during the CDT revealed that PD participants showed more moderate slopes than the HC in the right hemisphere in the command (p&#160;=&#160;0.042) and copy task (p&#160;=&#160;0.009). Better score on the measurement of information processing correlated with steeper right hemisphere HbO2 slope in the copy task in the PD group (p&#160;=&#160;0.003). Our results reflect slower PFC activation in participants with PD which correlates with behavioral measures.

Cognitive-behavioural treatments have been most extensively studied, but they tend to have small effects of temporary duration. Emotional awareness and expression therapy (EAET) is a newly developed treatment for SSD, targeting emotional processing of trauma and conflict as a mechanism of symptom change. In an earlier uncontrolled study of self-guided, internet-administrated EAET (I-EAET), we found substantial reductions in somatic symptoms, prompting the need for a randomized controlled trial of I-EAET. We conducted a 2-arm RCT, comparing 10-week I-EAET (n&#160;=&#160;37) to a waitlist control (WL; n&#160;=&#160;37). Primary outcomes were reductions of somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) and pain intensity (BPI-4) at post-treatment, with a 4-month evaluation of effect duration. We also analysed emotional processing (EPS-25) and depression (PHQ-9) as possible mediators of I-EAET's effects. Compared to controls, I-EAET significantly reduced somatic symptoms at both post-treatment and follow-up. I-EAET also reduced pain, depression, insomnia, and anxiety at post-treatment, but these effects were not retained at follow-up. As hypothesized, a facet of emotional processing partially mediated the treatment effect on somatic symptoms, even when controlling for depression. Although treatment effects were smaller than in the previous uncontrolled trial, I-EAET is a promising treatment for SSD, with a minority of patients (around 20%) experiencing substantial clinical improvement. The benefits of I-EAET are partially mediated by improved emotional processing. Future research should identify and target patients who respond best to I-EAET and develop tailored treatment to enhance treatment effects.

After the PMv-M1 cc-PAS the corticospinal excitability negative correlates with the I2 -wave amplitude. Different cc-PAS coil orientations can lead to a LTP- or LTD-like after-effect in M1. Background: The functional connection between ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary motor cortex (M1) is critical for the organization of goal directed actions. Repeated activation of this connection by means of cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (cc-PAS), a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol, may induce Hebbian-like plasticity. However, the physiological modifications produced by Hebbian-like plasticity in the PMv-M1 network are poorly understood. To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of cc-PAS on PMv-M1 circuits. We hypothesized that specific interactions would occur with I2 -wave interneurons as measured by the short intracortical facilitation protocol (SICF). We used different paired-pulse TMS protocols to examine the effects of PMv-M1 cc-PAS on SICF, on GABAergic circuits as measured by short (SICI) and long (LICI) intracortical inhibition protocols and varied the current direction in M1 to target different M1 neuronal populations. Finally, we examined the effects of cc-PAS on PMv-M1 connectivity using a dual coil approach. We found that PMv-M1 cc-PAS induces both LTP- or LTD-like aftereffect in M1 neuronal activity that is strongly associated with bidirectional specific change in the I2 -wave activity (SICF = 2.5 ms ISI). Moreover, cc-PAS induces a specific modulation of LICI circuit and separately modulates PMv-M1 connectivity. We suggest that plasticity within the PMv-M1 circuit is mediated by a selective mechanism exerted by PMv on M1 by targeting the I2 -wave interneurons. These results provide new mechanistic insight on how PMv modulates M1 activity that are relevant for the design of brain stimulation protocols in health and disease. Abstract figure legend The abstract represents the neural circuits involved in plasticity induction after the PMv-to-M1 cc-PAS. Left part shows the cc-PAS coil orientations: Postero-Anterior (PA) and Antero-Posterior (AP). Right blocks show the neural circuits preferentially activated by the different coil orientations. The pyramidal neuron (PN) (purple) receives both excitatory (red) and inhibitory (grey) synaptic inputs responsible of the I2 -waves generations. The PMv projections (light blue) contact the interneurons within M1 both in layers 2-3 (L2-3) and in L5. The cc-PASPA protocol preferentially target the deep neuron populations in L5, increasing the corticospinal excitability (CSE) and inhibiting the I2 -waves circuits (top block). On the other side, the AP stimulation activates the more superficial neuronal populations in L2-3, inhibiting the dendritic arbour of the PN, leading to a reduction of CSE and a simultaneous increase in the activity of the I2 -wave circuit (bottom block).

A number of modeling papers have addressed the question of how grid firing behaviors emerge using (for example) ideas borrowed from dynamical systems (attractors) or from coupled oscillator theory. Here we&#160;use a different approach: instead of asking how&#160;grid behavior emerges, we take as a given the experimentally observed intracellular potentials of superficial medial EC neurons during grid firing. Employing a detailed neural circuit model modified from a lateral EC&#160;model, we then ask&#160;how the circuit responds when group of medial EC principal neurons exhibit such potentials, simultaneously with a simulated theta frequency input from the septal nuclei. The model predicts the emergence of robust theta-modulated gamma/beta oscillations, suggestive of oscillations observed in an in vitro medial EC experimental model (Cunningham, M.O., Pervouchine, D.D., Racca, C., Kopell, N.J., Davies, C.H., Jones, R.S.G., Traub, R.D., and Whittington, M.A. (2006).

Such oscillations result because feedback interneurons tightly synchronize with each other&#160;- despite the varying phases of the grid cells&#160;- and generate a robust inhibition-based rhythm. The lack of spatial specificity of the model interneurons is consistent with the lack of spatial periodicity in parvalbumin interneurons observed by Buetfering, C., Allen, K., and Monyer, H. (2014).

Understanding the principles that govern this binocular combination process has important real-world clinical and technological applications. However, most research examining binocular combination has relied on relatively simple visual stimuli and it is unclear how well the findings apply to real-world scenarios. For example, it is well-known that, when the two eyes view sine wave gratings with differing contrast (dichoptic stimuli), the binocular percept often matches the higher contrast grating. Does this winner-take-all property of binocular contrast combination apply to more naturalistic imagery, which include broadband structure and spatially varying contrast? To better understand binocular combination during naturalistic viewing, we conducted psychophysical experiments characterizing binocular contrast perception for a range of visual stimuli. In two experiments, we measured the binocular contrast perception of dichoptic sine wave gratings and naturalistic stimuli, and asked how the contrast of the surrounding context affected percepts. Binocular contrast percepts were close to winner-take-all across many of the stimuli when the surrounding context was the average contrast of the two eyes. However, we found that changing the surrounding context modulated the binocular percept of some patterns and not others. We show evidence that this contextual effect may be due to the spatial orientation structure of the stimuli. These findings provide a step toward understanding binocular combination in the natural world and highlight the importance of considering the effect of the spatial interactions in complex stimuli.", "query": "no_model"}, "36326690": {"ArticleTitle": "KCa1.1 channels contribute to optogenetically driven post-stimulation silencing in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons.", "AbstractText": "Using cell-attached recordings from molecular layer interneurons (MLI) of the cerebellar cortex of adult mice expressing channel rhodopsin 2, we show that wide-field optical activation induces an increase in firing rate during illumination and a firing pause when the illumination ends (post-stimulation silencing; PSS). Significant spike rate changes with respect to basal firing rate were observed for optical activations lasting 200 ms and 1 s as well as for 1 s long trains of 10 ms pulses at 50 Hz. For all conditions, the net effect of optical activation on the integrated spike rate is significantly reduced because of PSS. Three lines of evidence indicate that this PSS is due to intrinsic factors. Firstly, PSS is induced when the optical stimulation is restricted to a single MLI using a 405-nm laser delivering a diffraction-limited spot at the focal plane. Secondly, PSS is not affected by block of GABA-A or GABA-B receptors, ruling out synaptic interactions amongst MLIs. Thirdly, PSS is mimicked in whole-cell recording experiments by step depolarizations under current clamp. Activation of Ca-dependent K channels during the spike trains appears as a likely candidate to underlie PSS. Using immunocytochemistry, we find that one such channel type, KCa1.1, is present in the somato-dendritic and axonal compartments of MLIs. In cell-attached recordings, charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin significantly reduce the optically induced PSS, while TRAM-34 does not affect it, suggesting that KCa1.1 channels, but not KCa3.1 channels, contribute to PSS.", "query": "no_model"}, "36326686": {"ArticleTitle": "IGF1 gene therapy in middle-aged female rats delays reproductive senescence through its effects on hypothalamic GnRH and kisspeptin neurons.", "AbstractText": "The process of aging is the result of progressive loss of homeostasis and functional body impairment, including the central nervous system, where the hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating aging mechanisms.

In this work, we investigated the effect of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene therapy on hypothalamic kisspeptin/GnRH neurons and on microglial cells, that mediate the inflammatory process related with the aging process. The results show that IGF1 rats have higher kisspeptin expression in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nucleus and higher immunoreactivity of GnRH in the arcuate nucleus and median eminence. In addition, IGF1-treated animals exhibit increased numbers of Iba1+ microglial cells and MHCII+/Iba1+ in the AVPV and arcuate nuclei. In conclusion, IGF1 gene therapy maintains kisspeptin production in the AVPV nucleus, induces GnRH release in the median eminence, and alters the number and reactivity of microglial cells in middle-aged female rats.

Young adult heavy drinkers (N = 61; 57% male) completed two smartphone-based, 3-hr HR-EMA of drinking context (social context and location), alcohol use, and subjective responses (alcohol stimulation, sedation, feeling, liking, and wanting more). Analyses examined the associations between drinking context and subjective alcohol responses, accounting for demographic characteristics and individual differences in alcohol consumption.

The present study extends prior laboratory-based research and shows that subjective responses during naturalistic binge drinking episodes may be influenced by drinking context.

However, it is not yet known the degree to which these entrainment abnormalities covary within subjects across sensory modalities. Furthermore, the degree to which cross-modal gamma entrainment reflects variation in biological processes associated with cognitive performance remains unclear. We used EEG to measure entrainment to repetitive auditory and visual stimulation at beta (20 Hz) and gamma (30 and 40 Hz) frequencies in PSZ (n = 78) and healthy control subjects (HCS; n = 80). Three indices were measured for each frequency and modality: event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), intertrial coherence (ITC), and phase-lag angle (PLA). Cognition and symptom severity were also assessed. We found little evidence that gamma entrainment covaried across sensory modalities. PSZ exhibited a modest correlation between modalities at 40 Hz for ERSP and ITC measures (r = 0.23-0.24); however, no other significant correlations between modalities emerged for either HCS or PSZ. Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that (a) the pattern of entrainment abnormalities in PSZ differed across modalities, and (b) modality rather than frequency band was the main source of variance. Finally, we observed a significant association between cognition and gamma entrainment in the auditory domain only in HCS. Gamma-band EEG entrainment does not reflect a unitary transcortical mechanism but is instead modality specific. To the extent that entrainment reflects the integrity of cortical E-I balance, the deficits observed in PSZ appear to be modality specific and not consistently associated with cognitive impairment.

Using Latent Change Score Models to analyze 26,166 observations, the study empirically corroborates that critical fluctuations in depressive symptomatology within and across individuals occur during the first 3 months of the pandemic, after which symptom profiles are predominantly consolidated throughout the pandemic period. Contrary to established belief, female sex, young age, lower education and preexisting psychiatric diagnosis only served as adequate predictors of the initial shocks to symptomatology observed during the onset of the pandemic and did not adequately predict subsequent change observed in symptoms within and across individuals. Population-level analyses demonstrated that symptom levels strongly covaried with the presence and strictness of SDPs and were unrelated to COVID-19 incidence rates. Upon predominant termination of SDPs, population-level symptoms began declining, while large heterogeneity was present across the adult population. Detrimental long-term adversities were revealed by 10% of the adults. These individuals displayed chaotic adaptation to the pandemic and its SDPs, exhibiting substantial increases in clinical levels of symptomatology ensuing partial reopening of society and through the remainder of the pandemic, with these deleterious symptoms projected to remain heightened ahead.

Latent moderated structural equation models demonstrated that preschool executive control significantly moderated the associations between preschool negative emotionality and general psychopathology both in preschool and approximately 5 years later in elementary school.

It is too simplistic to conclude that decreases in motor cortical or motoneuronal excitability may contribute to central fatigue and impaired performance as some studies show increased corticomotoneuronal excitability in some exercise modalities. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as serotonin released from neurones, can alter central fatigue and motoneuronal output. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as non-invasive brain stimulation, may also do this, but current evidence is not convincing. Further well-controlled studies and replications are needed to expose the cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance ABSTRACT: Neural drive originating in higher brain areas reaches exercising limb muscles through the corticospinal-motoneuronal pathway which links the motor cortex and spinal motoneurones. The properties of this pathway have frequently been observed to change during fatiguing exercise in ways that could influence the development of central fatigue, i.e. the progressive reduction in voluntary muscle activation. However, based on differences in motor cortical and motoneuronal excitability between exercise modalities (e.g. single-joint vs locomotor exercise), there is no characteristic response that allows for a categorical conclusion about the effect of these changes on functional impairments and performance limitations. Despite the lack of uniformity in findings during fatigue, there is strong evidence for marked 'inhibition' of motoneurones as a direct result of voluntary drive. Endogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as via serotonin released from neurones, can directly affect motoneuronal output and central fatigue. Exogenous forms of neuromodulation, such as brain stimulation, may achieve a similar effect, but the evidence is weak. Non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation can cause transient or long-lasting changes in cortical excitability, however, variable results across studies cast doubt on its claimed capacity to enhance performance. Furthermore, with these studies it is difficult to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between brain responsiveness and exercise performance. This review briefly summarises changes in the corticomotoneuronal pathway during various types of exercise, considers the relevance of these changes for the development of central fatigue, and the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance motor cortical excitability, motoneuronal output, and, ultimately, exercise performance. Abstract figure legend Abstract Figure illustrating main components of the corticospinal-motoneuronal pathway and factors influencing its properties, and potentially performance, during fatiguing exercise.

Between 2018 and 2020, 504 women were recruited to this prospective longitudinal cohort study. At 2 to 3&#160;months postpartum, their pelvic floor muscles and diastasis recti abdominis were assessed using vaginal palpation, observation, and caliper measurement. The participants completed the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire (PGQ) at 2 to 3, 6, 9, and 12&#160;months postpartum. Mixed-effect models were used to determine how the results of pelvic floor muscle and diastasis recti abdominis assessments predicted the PGQ score. A subanalysis for middle to high PGQ scores was conducted. Maximal voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions of &#8805;3 (Modified Oxford Scale, scored from 0 to 5) predicted a decreased PGQ score (&#946;&#160;=&#8201;-3.13 [95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;-5.77 to -0.48]) at 2 to 3&#160;months postpartum, with a higher prediction of a middle to high PGQ score (&#946;&#160;=&#8201;-6.39). Diastasis recti abdominis width did not have any significant correlation with the PGQ score. A subanalysis showed that a diastasis recti abdominis width of &#8805;35&#160;mm predicted an increased PGQ score (&#946;&#160;=&#8201;5.38 [95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;1.21 to 9.55]) in women with pelvic girdle pain. The distinction between weak and strong maximal voluntary pelvic floor muscle contractions is an important clinical assessment in women with postpartum pelvic girdle pain. The exact diastasis recti abdominis width, measured in millimeters, showed no clinical relevance. However, a diastasis recti abdominis width of &#8805;35&#160;mm was associated with a higher PGQ score, and further research about this cutoff point in relation to pain is needed. This study highlights the importance of clinical assessment of pelvic floor muscles in patients with postpartum pelvic girdle pain.

To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at perceptual disorders after stroke compared to no intervention or control (placebo, standard care, attention control), on measures of performance in activities of daily living.&#160; SEARCH METHODS: We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases to August 2021. We also searched trials and research registers, reference lists of studies, handsearched journals, and contacted authors. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult stroke survivors with perceptual disorders.&#160;We defined perception as the&#160;specific mental functions of recognising and interpreting sensory stimuli and included hearing, taste, touch, smell, somatosensation, and vision.&#160;Our definition of perception excluded visual field deficits, neglect/inattention, and pain. One review author assessed titles, with two review authors independently screening abstracts and full-text articles for eligibility. One review author extracted, appraised, and entered data, which were checked by a second author. We assessed risk of bias (ROB) using the ROB-1 tool, and quality of evidence using GRADE.&#160; A stakeholder group, comprising stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, was involved in this review update. We identified 18 eligible RCTs involving 541 participants. The trials addressed touch (three trials, 70 participants), somatosensory (seven trials, 196 participants) and visual perception disorders (seven trials, 225 participants), with one (50 participants) exploring mixed touch-somatosensory disorders. None addressed stroke-related hearing, taste, or smell perception disorders. All but one examined the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions; the exception evaluated non-invasive brain stimulation. For our main comparison of active intervention versus no treatment or control, one trial reported our primary outcome of performance in activities of daily living (ADL):&#160; Somatosensory disorders: one trial (24 participants) compared an intervention with a control intervention and reported an ADL measure.&#160; Touch perception disorder: no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or with a control intervention.&#160; Visual perception disorders: no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or control.&#160; In addition, six trials reported ADL outcomes in a comparison of active intervention versus active intervention, relating to somatosensation (three trials), touch (one trial) and vision (two trials). &#160; AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Following a detailed, systematic search, we identified limited RCT evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that perceptual interventions are effective. More high-quality trials of interventions for perceptual disorders in stroke are&#160;needed.

We used data from a multicenter 5-year prospective cohort, including 634 in- and out-patients with schizophrenia, bipolar or major depressive disorder. Metabolic syndrome was assessed at baseline following NCEP-ATPIII criteria. Cause of death was categorized as cardiovascular disorder (CVD) mortality, non-CVD disease-related mortality (e.g., infections), suicide and accident. 122 participants (44.0%) were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome at baseline. In the full sample, there was no significant association between metabolic syndrome or any of its components with all-cause, CVD and non-CVD mortality.

Our findings do not support an association between metabolic syndrome and increased mortality in older patients with major psychiatric disorders. Several explanations are discussed, including a survival bias, a lack of sensitivity of the used cut-offs and a ceiling effect of metabolic syndrome on mortality in this very high-risk population.

Most studies investigating BBB EC function lack physiological relevance, using sub-physiological shear stress magnitudes and/or omitting pericytes and astrocytes. In this study, we developed a millifluidic device compatible with standard transwell inserts to investigate BBB function. In contrast to standard polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices, this model allows for easy, reproducible shear stress exposure without common limitations of PDMS devices such as inadequate nutrient diffusion and air bubble formation. In no-flow conditions, we first used the device to examine the impact of primary human pericytes and astrocytes on human brain microvascular EC (HBMEC) barrier integrity. Astrocytes, pericytes, and a 1-to-1 ratio of both cell types increased HBMEC barrier integrity via reduced 3 and 40 kDa fluorescent dextran permeability and increased claudin-5 expression. There were differing levels of low 3 kDa permeability in HBMEC-pericyte, HBMEC-astrocyte, and HBMEC-astrocyte-pericyte co-cultures, while levels of low 40 kDa permeability were consistent across co-cultures. The 3 kDa findings suggest that pericytes provide more barrier support to the BBB model compared to astrocytes, although both supportive cell types are permeability reducers. Incorporation of 24-hour 12 dynes per cm2 flow significantly reduced dextran permeability in HBMEC monolayers, but not in the tri-culture model. These results indicate that tri-culture may exert more pronounced impact on overall BBB permeability than flow exposure. In both cases, monolayer and tri-culture, flow exposure interestingly reduced HBMEC expression of both claudin-5 and occludin. ZO-1 expression, and localization at cell-cell junctions increased in the tri-culture but exhibited no apparent change in the HBMEC monolayer. Under flow conditions, we also observed HBMEC alignment in the tri-culture but not in HBMEC monolayers, indicating supportive cells and flow are both essential to observe brain EC alignment in vitro. Collectively, these results support the necessity of physiologically relevant, multicellular BBB models when investigating BBB EC function.

After replacement of the original signal peptide sequence with the Ig Kappa leader sequence, codon-optimized NGFR100W mRNA yielded high secretion of mature NGFR100W , which promoted axon growth in PC12 cells. Using lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-delivery of N1-methylpseudouridine-modified mRNA in mice, NGFR100W -mRNA-LNPs resulted in the successful expression of NGFR100W protein, which significantly reduced nociceptive activity compared to that of NGFWT .

Data from 245 older adult participants (aged 72-78 years) from the fourth assessment of the Personality and Total Health Through Life study were analyzed. A diagnostic algorithm identified 103 participants with MCI, with subtypes of single-domain amnestic MCI (aMCI-single; n = 38), multi-domain amnestic MCI (aMCI-multi; n = 31), and non-amnestic MCI (n = 33), who were compared with an age-, sex-, education-, and income-matched sample of 142 cognitively unimpaired older adults. Decision-making scores on the GDT (net score, single number choices, and strategy changes) were compared between groups using nonparametric tests. Participants with MCI showed impaired performance on the GDT, with higher frequencies of single number choices and strategy changes. Analyses comparing MCI subtypes indicated that the aMCI-multi subtype showed increased frequency of single number choices compared to cognitively unimpaired participants. Across the sample of participants, decision-making scores were associated with measures of executive function (cognitive flexibility and set shifting). MCI is associated with impaired decision-making performance under explicit risk conditions. Participants with impairments in multiple domains of cognition showed the clearest impairments.

The TBI research literature is fragmented further because often studies of distinct populations have used different assessment procedures and instruments. Addressing calls to harmonize the literature will require tools to link data collected from different instruments that measure the same construct, such as civilian mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and sports concussion symptom inventories. We used item response theory (IRT) to link scores from the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) symptom checklist, widely used instruments for assessing civilian and sport-related mTBI symptoms, respectively. The sample included data from n = 397 patients who suffered a sports-related concussion, civilian mTBI, orthopedic injury control, or non-athlete control and completed the SCAT and/or RPQ. The results of several analyses supported sufficient unidimensionality to treat the RPQ + SCAT combined item set as measuring a single construct. Fixed-parameter IRT was used to create a cross-walk table that maps RPQ total scores to SCAT symptom severity scores. Linked and observed scores were highly correlated (r = .92). Standard errors of the IRT scores were slightly higher for civilian mTBI patients and orthopedic controls, particularly for RPQ scores linked from the SCAT.

Most frequently they appear since the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage preceding clinical AD, and have a prognostic importance. Unfortunately, these symptoms also worsen the daily functioning of patients, increase caregiver stress and accelerate the disease progression from MCI to AD. Apathy and depression are the most common of these NPS, and much attention has been given in recent years to understand the biological mechanisms related to their appearance in AD. Although for many decades these symptoms have been known to be related to abnormalities of the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), a direct association between deficits in the VTA and NPS in AD has never been investigated. Fortunately, this scenario is changing since recent studies using preclinical models of AD, and clinical studies in MCI and AD patients demonstrated a number of functional, structural and metabolic alterations affecting the VTA dopaminergic neurons and their mesocorticolimbic targets. These findings appear early, since the MCI stage, and seem to correlate with the appearance of NPS. Here, we provide an overview of the recent evidence directly linking the dopaminergic VTA with NPS in AD and propose a setting in which the precocious identification of dopaminergic deficits can be a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis. In this scenario, treatments of patients with dopaminergic drugs might slow down the disease progression and delay the impairment of daily living activities.", "query": "no_model"}, "36325520": {"ArticleTitle": "Using 2D and 3D pluripotent stem cell models to study neurotropic viruses.", "AbstractText": "Understanding the impact of viral pathogens on the human central nervous system (CNS) has been challenging due to the lack of viable human CNS models for controlled experiments to determine the causal factors underlying pathogenesis.

Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be induced to neural lineages in either two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cultures, each bearing distinct advantages and limitations for modeling viral pathogenesis and evaluating effective therapeutics.

We focus on several viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Zika virus (ZIKV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), SARS-CoV-2, West Nile virus (WNV)) to illustrate key advantages, as well as challenges, of PSC-based models. We also discuss how human PSC-based models can be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic drugs by generating data that are complementary to existing preclinical models.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neurophysiological technique for measuring brain activity, and although much is known about EEG activity in acute and chronic substance use, knowledge regarding EEG in relation to abstinence and treatment outcomes is sparse. We performed a scoping review of longitudinal and pre-post treatment EEG studies that explored putative changes in brain function associated with abstinence and/or treatment in individuals with SUD. Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified studies published between January 2000 and March 2022 from online databases. Search keywords included EEG, addictive substances (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine), and treatment related terms (e.g., abstinence, relapse). Selected studies used EEG at least at one time point as a predictor of abstinence or other treatment-related outcomes; or examined pre- vs. post-SUD intervention (brain stimulation, pharmacological, behavioral) EEG effects. Studies were also rated on the risk of bias and quality using validated instruments. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. More consistent findings included lower oddball P3 and higher resting beta at baseline predicting negative outcomes, and abstinence-mediated longitudinal decrease in cue-elicited P3 amplitude and resting beta power. Other findings included abstinence or treatment-related changes in late positive potential (LPP) and N2 amplitudes, as well as in delta and theta power. Existing studies were heterogeneous and limited in terms of specific substances of interest, brief times for follow-ups, and inconsistent or sparse results. Encouragingly, in this limited but maturing literature, many studies demonstrated partial associations of EEG markers with abstinence, treatment outcomes, or pre-post treatment-effects. Studies were generally of good quality in terms of risk of bias. More EEG studies are warranted to better understand abstinence- or treatment-mediated neural changes or to predict SUD treatment outcomes. Future research can benefit from prospective large-sample cohorts and the use of standardized methods such as task batteries.

Although it is likely that systemic infections are a common trigger for urgent tertiary care needs in LTNCs, there is a lack of data. Yet this is important since systemic infections are a modifiable risk factor, and hence the motivation for a formal evaluation. We undertook case note review of 155 consecutive unselected adult patients with LTNC receiving urgent care at a tertiary hospital between November and December 2019. Data were collected on presenting symptoms, diagnosis, length of stay, complications, and change in social needs. The most common LTNCs were neurocognitive disorders (n&#160;=&#160;68, 44%), cerebrovascular disorders (n&#160;=&#160;65, 42%), and epilepsy (n&#160;=&#160;19, 12%).

Mouse models can serve as an important tool for the investigation of biomarkers in glioblastoma, but several glioblastoma models indicated only low TSPO-PET signals in contrast to high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma. Thus, we aimed to investigate TSPO-PET imaging in the syngeneic immunocompetent SB28 mouse model, which is thought to closely represent the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human glioblastoma. Dynamic TSPO-PET/CT imaging was performed for 60 min after injection of 13.6 &#177; 4.2 MBq [18F]GE-180. Contrast enhanced CT (ceCT) was acquired prior to PET and served for assessment of tumor volumes and attenuation correction. SB28 and sham mice were imaged at an early (week-1; n = 6 SB28, n = 6 sham) and a late time-point (week-3; n = 8 SB28, n = 9 sham) after inoculation. Standard of truth ex vivo tumor volumes were obtained for SB28 mice at the late time-point. Tracer kinetics were analyzed for the lesion site and the carotid arteries to establish an image derived input function (IDIF). TSPO-PET and ceCT lesion volumes were compared with ex vivo volumes by calculation of root-mean-square-errors (RMSE). Volumes of distribution (VTmax/mean) in the lesion were calculated using carotid IDIF and standardized uptake values (SUVmax/mean) were obtained for a 40-60 min time frame. Higher uptake rate constants (K1) were observed for week-1 SB28 tumor lesions when compared to week-3 SB28 tumor lesions. Highest agreement between TSPO-PET lesion volumes and ex vivo tumor volumes was achieved with a 50% maximum threshold (RMSE-VT: 39.7%; RMSE-SUV: 34.4%), similar to the agreement of ceCT tumor volumes (RMSE: 30.1%). Lesions of SB28 mice had higher PET signal when compared to sham mice at week-1 (VTmax 6.6 &#177; 2.9 vs. 3.9 &#177; 0.8, p = 0.035; SUVmax 2.3 &#177; 0.5 vs. 1.2 &#177; 0.1, p < 0.001) and PET signals remained at a similar level at week-3 (VTmax 5.0 &#177; 1.6 vs. 2.7 &#177; 0.8, p = 0.029; SUVmax 1.9 &#177; 0.5 vs. 1.2 &#177; 0.2, p = 0.0012). VTmax correlated with SUVmax (R 2 = 0.532, p < 0.001). TSPO-PET imaging of immunocompetent SB28 mice facilitates early detection of tumor signals over sham lesions.

However, the nature of these consequences has yet to be systematically examined. <b>Objective:</b> This systematic review sought to identify and document deployment-related encounters with children and associated outcomes reported by military personnel, as well as identify any current training programs, policies, or procedures in place regarding encountering children during deployment. <b>Method:</b> A total of 17 studies with 86 independent samples were included. Analyses were based primarily on qualitative data. <b>Results:</b> Based on the review, 77 military personnel samples documented their experiences encountering children during deployment. Most commonly, child encounters included armed children, porters/human shields, suicide bombers, and ambiguous interactions. Outcomes from encountering children during deployment were diverse, occurring both during the encounter, and described by many as persisting years following the exposure. Consequences of encounters as described by military personnel included: hesitation to complete mission objectives, mental health concerns, moral struggles, social isolation, and sleep disturbances. Of the 86 included reports, only nine provided information regarding training at any stage (pre-, during, or post-deployment) in relation to encountering children. Much of the available information underscored the lack of training, with six reports highlighting the lack of pre-deployment training and five reports describing the lack of policies, including rules of engagement, as they relate to encountering children during deployment. Only two reports described post-deployment procedures made available to military personnel following exposure to children while on deployment. <b>Conclusions:</b> Results from this review will be used to identify available research, develop and support training initiatives, and increase awareness regarding implications of encountering children during deployment. We further provide recommendations regarding research needs, policy implementation, and current training gaps. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Los miembros de las fuerzas militares reportan mayor exposici&#243;n al trauma y posterior trastorno de estr&#233;s postraum&#225;tico (TEPT), comparados con civiles. Los encuentros con ni&#241;os en escenarios de guerra y conflictos pueden tener consecuencias particularmente inquietantes, sin embargo, la naturaleza de estas consecuencias a&#250;n no se ha examinado sistem&#225;ticamente.<b>Objetivo</b>: Esta revisi&#243;n sistem&#225;tica busc&#243; identificar y documentar los encuentros con ni&#241;os relacionados con el despliegue militar, y los resultados asociados reportados por el personal militar, as&#237; como identificar cualquier programa de capacitaci&#243;n, pol&#237;tica o procedimiento vigente en relaci&#243;n con el encuentro con ni&#241;os durante el despliegue militar.<b>M&#233;todo</b>: Se incluyeron un total de 17 estudios con 86 muestras independientes. Los an&#225;lisis se basaron principalmente en datos cualitativos.<b>Resultados</b>: Seg&#250;n la revisi&#243;n, 77 muestras de personal militar documentaron experiencias al encontrarse con ni&#241;os durante el despliegue. M&#225;s com&#250;nmente, los encuentros con ni&#241;os incluyeron ni&#241;os armados, porteadores/escudos humanos, terroristas suicidas e interacciones ambiguas. Los resultados del encuentro con ni&#241;os durante el despliegue fueron diversos, ocurriendo durante el encuentro, y siendo descritos por muchos como persistentes a&#241;os despu&#233;s de la exposici&#243;n. Las consecuencias de los encuentros descritas por el personal militar incluyeron: vacilaci&#243;n para completar los objetivos de la misi&#243;n, problemas de salud mental, luchas morales, aislamiento social y trastornos del sue&#241;o.

The space between these membranes contains mainly cerebrospinal fluid. It is of interest to study how the volumes of this space change with respect to normal aging. In this work, we propose to combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with nested topology-preserving geometric deformable models (NTGDMs) to reconstruct meningeal surfaces from magnetic resonance (MR) images. We first use CNNs to predict implicit representations of these surfaces then refine them with NTGDMs to achieve sub-voxel accuracy while maintaining spherical topology and the correct anatomical ordering. MR contrast harmonization is used to match the contrasts between training and testing images. We applied our algorithm to a subset of healthy subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging for demonstration purposes and conducted longitudinal statistical analysis of the intracranial volume (ICV) and subarachnoid space (SAS) volume.

Sucrose preference, motivation and self-care, immobility latency and plasma corticosterone were evaluated after 24&#160;h of last stressor. After behavioral assessments TNF-&#945;, Il-6 and BDNF immunocontent was determined in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. A.&#160;aspera extract as well as betaine improved sucrose preference, increased grooming frequency and latency in splash test and ameliorated depression-like condition in CUMS mice in Porsolt test.

As intranasal oxytocin has been shown to modulate activation of the brain's reward circuit, oxytocin might ameliorate the processing of social rewards in ASD and thus improve social difficulties. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined effects of a 24-IU dose of intranasal oxytocin on reward-related brain function in 37 men with ASD without intellectual impairment and 37 age- and IQ-matched control participants. Participants performed an incentive delay task that allows the investigation of neural activity associated with the anticipation and receipt of monetary and social rewards. Nonsignificant tests suggested that oxytocin did not influence neural processes related to the anticipation of social or monetary rewards in either group. Complementary Bayesian analyses indicated moderate evidence for a null model, relative to an alternative model.

Mindfulness is now a focus of neuroimaging, since technical and methodological developments in magnetic resonance imaging have made it possible to observe subjects performing mindfulness tasks. We set out to describe the association between mental processes and characteristics of mindfulness, including their specific cerebral patterns, as shown in structural and functional neuroimaging studies. We searched the MEDLINE databank of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics via PubMed using the keywords: \"mindfulness,\" \"focused attention (FA),\" \"open monitoring (OM),\" \"mind wandering,\" \"emotional regulation,\" \"magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\" and \"default mode network (DMN).\" This review extracted phenomenological experiences across populations with varying degrees of mindfulness training and correlated these experiences with structural and functional neuroimaging patterns. Our goal was to describe how mindful behavior was processed by the constituents of the default mode network during specific tasks. Depending on the research paradigm employed to explore mindfulness, investigations of function that used fMRI exhibited distinct activation patterns and functional connectivities. Basic to mindfulness is a long-term process of learning to use meditation techniques. Meditators progress from voluntary control of emotions and subjective preferences to emotional regulation and impartial awareness of phenomena. As their ability to monitor perception and behavior, a metacognitive skill, improves, mindfulness increases self-specifying thoughts governed by the experiential phenomenological self and reduces self-relational thoughts of the narrative self. The degree of mindfulness (ratio of self-specifying to self-relational thoughts) may affect other mental processes, e.g., awareness, working memory, mind wandering and belief formation. Mindfulness prevents habituation and the constant assumptions associated with mindlessness. Self-specifying thinking during mindfulness and self-relational thinking in the narrative self relies on the default mode network. The main constituents of this network are the dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. These midline structures are antagonistic to self-specifying and self-relational processes, since the predominant process determines their differential involvement.

Our data are consistent with previous reports that the adult ChI pause is dependent on dopamine signaling, but we find that the robust pausing at P10 is dopamine independent. Instead, elevated expression of the noninactivating delayed rectifier Kv7.2/3 current promotes pausing in infantile ChIs.

Age of onset of DSM-5 AUD was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Predictive power was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and by analysis of the distribution of PRS. European ancestry subjects with higher than median PRSs were at greater risk for onset of AUD than subjects with lower than median PRSs (p&#160;= 3&#160;&#215; 10-7). Area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic analysis peaked at 0.88 to 0.95 using PRS plus sex, family history, comorbid disorders, age at first drink, and peer drinking; predictive power was primarily driven by clinical variables. In this high-risk sample, European ancestry subjects with a PRS score in the highest quartile showed a 72% risk for developing AUD and a 35% risk of developing severe AUD (compared with risks of 54% and 16%, respectively, in the lowest quartile). Predictive power for PRSs in the extremes of the distribution suggests that these may have future clinical utility.

We systematically reviewed and critically appraised functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task-based functional connectivity studies in ADHD. A systematic search conducted up to September 2020 found 34 studies, including 51 comparisons. Comparisons were divided into investigations of ADHD neuropathology (37 comparing ADHD and typical development, 2 comparing individuals with ADHD and their nonsymptomatic siblings, 2 comparing remitted and persistent ADHD, and 1 exploring ADHD symptom severity) and the effects of interventions (8 investigations of stimulant effects and 1 study of fMRI neurofeedback). Large heterogeneity in study methodologies prevented a meta-analysis; thus, the data were summarized as a narrative synthesis. Across cognitive domains, functional connectivity in the cingulo-opercular, sensorimotor, visual, subcortical, and executive control networks in ADHD consistently differed from neurotypical populations. Furthermore, literature comparing individuals with ADHD and their nonsymptomatic siblings as well as adults with ADHD and their remitted peers showed ADHD-related abnormalities in similar sensorimotor and subcortical (primarily striatal) networks. Interventions modulated those dysfunctional networks, with the most consistent action on functional connections with the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, occipital regions, and midline default mode network structures.

Current pharmacological treatments have rather nonspecific mechanisms of action. Somatostatin is synthesized and released as an inhibitory co-neurotransmitter by specific GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons, and one of its receptors, SSTR4 (somatostatin receptor 4), is localized in brain regions involved in adaptive aversion processing and implicated in negative valence neuropathology, including the amygdala. Rat and mouse experiments were conducted to investigate effects of specific SSTR4 agonism on neurobehavioral aversion processing, including any normalization of stress-related hyperresponsiveness. A mouse experiment to investigate stress and SSTR4 agonism effects on reward processing was also conducted. In male rats (n&#160;= 5-10/group) fitted with glutamate biosensors in basolateral amygdala, SSTR4 agonism attenuated glutamate release to restraint stress in control rats and particularly in rats previously exposed to chronic corticosterone. In male mice (n&#160;= 10-18/group), SSTR4 agonism dose-dependently attenuated Pavlovian tone/footshock learning and memory measured as freezing behavior, in both control mice and mice exposed to chronic social stress, which induces excessive Pavlovian aversion learning and memory. Specificity of SSTR4 agonism effects to aversion learning/memory was demonstrated by absence of effects on discriminative reward (sucrose) learning/memory in both control mice and mice exposed to chronic social stress; SSTR4 agonism did increase reward-to-effort valuation in a dose-dependent manner and in both control mice and mice exposed to chronic social stress, which attenuates reward motivation.

Parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal striatum have been linked to repetitive behavior, and a sizable portion of these cells are surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures. Although PNNs have been associated with plasticity and neuropsychiatric disease, no previous studies have investigated their involvement in excessive repetitive behavior. We used histochemistry and confocal imaging to investigate PNNs surrounding parvalbumin-positive cells in the dorsal striatum of 4 mouse models of excessive repetitive behavior (BTBR, Cntnap2, Shank3, prenatal valproate treatment). We then investigated one of these models, the BTBR mouse, in detail, with DiI labeling, in&#160;vivo and in&#160;vitro recordings, and behavioral analyses. We next degraded PNNs in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) using the enzyme chondroitinase ABC and assessed dendritic spine density, electrophysiology, and repetitive behavior. We found a greater percentage of parvalbumin-positive interneurons with PNNs in the DMS of all 4 mouse models of excessive repetitive behavior compared with control mice. In BTBR mice, we found fewer dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons (targets of parvalbumin-positive interneurons) and differences in neuronal oscillations as well as inhibitory postsynaptic potentials compared with control mice. Reduction of DMS PNNs in BTBR mice altered dendritic spine density and inhibitory responses and normalized repetitive behavior.

Here, we identify abnormalities in parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) signaling in the mouse cerebellar cortex that may contribute to these pathologies. We used a mouse model for the human 15q11-13 duplication (patDp/+) and studied responses to sensory stimuli in Purkinje cells from awake mice using two-photon imaging of GCaMP6f signals. Moreover, we examined synaptic transmission and plasticity using in&#160;vitro electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and confocal microscopic techniques. We found that spontaneous and sensory-evoked CF-calcium transients are enhanced in patDp/+ Purkinje cells, and aversive movements are more severe across sensory modalities. We observed increased expression of the synaptic organizer NRXN1 at CF synapses and ectopic spread of these synapses to fine dendrites. CF-excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from Purkinje cells are enlarged in patDp/+ mice, while responses to PF stimulation are reduced. Confocal measurements show reduced PF+CF-evoked spine calcium transients, a key trigger for PF long-term depression, one of several plasticity types required for eyeblink conditioning learning. Long-term depression is impaired in patDp/+ mice but is rescued on pharmacological enhancement of calcium signaling. Our findings suggest that this genetic abnormality causes a pathological inflation of CF signaling, possibly resulting from enhanced NRXN1 expression, with consequences for the representation of sensory stimuli by the CF input and for PF synaptic organization and plasticity.", "query": "no_model"}, "36324626": {"ArticleTitle": "Antibody Delivery into the Brain by Radiosensitizer Nanoparticles for Targeted Glioblastoma Therapy.", "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma is the most lethal primary brain malignancy in adults.

IDT were performed for two pleasant (apple and jasmine) and two unpleasant (durian and trimethylamine) odorant stimuli. The experimenter presented one by one in a randomized order, the different odorant concentrations above IDT. Participants rated odor hedonic valence of these stimuli on a visual analog scale. Results showed, except for trimethylamine, the same relationship between hedonic ratings and stimulus concentration, i.e., an increase of pleasantness (apple and jasmine)/unpleasantness (durian) ratings at low and middle concentrations followed by a plateau at high concentrations. Correlations between OHR and concentrations as well as between OHR and threshold steps were always significant. Moreover, comparisons between both conditions showed that the correlation coefficient was significantly higher for trimethylamine (and a trend for apple) when IDTs were considered, while no difference was found for jasmine and durian. Overall, results suggested that the relationship between OHR and IDT is odor specific. These findings contribute to explain the large variability of the hedonic tone (i.e., weakly vs. very pleasant, weakly vs. very unpleasant) at specific concentration in the general population and could serve future research in this field (e.g., olfactory preferences in nutrition studies, anhedonia in psychiatric disorders&#8230;).", "query": "no_model"}, "36323711": {"ArticleTitle": "An innovative approach for the evaluation of prolonged disorders of consciousness using NF-L and GFAP biomarkers: a pivotal study.", "AbstractText": "Behavioral assessments during the clinical evaluation in prolonged disorders of consciousness patients could be not sufficient for a correct diagnosis and prognostication.

This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of published studies comparing neuropsychological outcomes between PRT and XRT. PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane were systematically searched for peer-reviewed published studies that compared neuropsychological outcomes between PRT and XRT in pediatric brain tumor patients. Eight studies were included. Six of the studies utilized retrospective neuropsychological data; the majority were longitudinal studies (n = 5). XRT was found to result in lower neuropsychological functioning across time. PRT was associated with generally stable neuropsychological functioning across time, with the exception of working memory and processing speed, which showed variable outcomes across studies. However, studies inconsistently included or considered medical and sociodemographic differences between treatment groups, which may have impacted neuropsychological outcomes.

In some individuals, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are the earliest manifestation of AD, observed in advance of clear cognitive decline. However, the few studies assessing AD biomarkers in association with NPS have often suffered from imprecision in capturing behavioral symptoms that represent sequalae of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the mild behavioral impairment (MBI) construct was developed, framing NPS in a way to improve the precision of risk estimates for disease. MBI core criteria stipulate that NPS emerge de novo in later-life and persist for at least six months. Here, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, we investigated associations of MBI with p-tau181, neuropsychological test performance, and incident AD. Cognitively unimpaired and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants were selected.

Linear regressions were fitted for cross-sectional analyses; multilevel linear mixed-effects and Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to examine longitudinal associations of MBI with changes in p-tau181 and cognition, and incident dementia. The sample included 571 participants (age 72.2, 46.8% female, 64.8% MCI).

One of the main unsolved questions in epilepsy is how epileptic activity can invade normal tissue and thus propagate across the brain. To investigate this question, we consider three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both the internal connectivity structure between neurons and the input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input is sometimes controlled by the network while in other instances, it can lead the network activity to itself produce paroxysmal activity, and thus will further propagate to efferent networks. We further show how the details of the network architecture are essential to determine this switch to a seizure-like regime. We investigated the nature of the instability involved and in particular found a central role for the inhibitory connectivity. We propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.SignificanceOur computational study shows the specific role that the inhibitory population can have and the possible dynamics regarding the propagation of seizure-like behavior in three different neuronal networks.

Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of these neurons increased cold sensitivity without affecting responses to other somatosensory modalities, while their chemogenetic activation reduced cold and also heat sensitivity.

Here, we review studies that documented age-related impact on memory distortions in the DRM and misinformation paradigms. Next, we examine the factors that underlie false memory susceptibility, with a focus on socio-emotional factors, and in particular aging stereotypes. We present recent results that highlighted the way negative age-related stereotypes might threaten older adults&#8217; and influence false memory susceptibility. Importantly, we also demonstrate that older adult&#8217;s memory distortions can easily be reduced when taking into account tasks&#8217; characteristics and participants&#8217; motivation. Finally, we discuss the implications of age-related stereotypes when older adults&#8217; memory is evaluated, both from a theoretical and an applied perspective.

Hospitalization increases the risk of sleep disturbances due to inactivity, some sensory deprivation and daytime hypovigilance.

Here, we report the discovery of temperature-sensitive ultradian rhythms in mammalian fibroblasts that are independent of both the cell cycle and the circadian clock. The period in each culture is stable over time but varies in different cultures (ranging from 3 to 24 h). We show that transient, single-cell metabolic pulses are synchronized into stable ultradian rhythms across contacting cells in culture by gap junction-mediated coupling. Coordinated rhythms are also apparent for other metabolic and physiological measures, including plasma membrane potential (&#916;&#968;<sub>p</sub>), intracellular glutamine, &#945;-ketoglutarate, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cytosolic pH, and intracellular calcium. Moreover, these ultradian rhythms require extracellular glutamine, several different ion channels, and the suppression of mitochondrial ATP synthase by &#945;-ketoglutarate, which provides a key feedback mechanism.

Controlled transport of bulky mitochondria is especially important in polarized cells such as neurons that rely on these organelles to locally produce energy and buffer calcium. Mitochondrial transport requires and depends on microtubules that fill much of the available axonal space. How mitochondrial transport is affected by their position within the microtubule bundles is not known. Here, we found that anterograde transport, driven by kinesin motors, is susceptible to the molecular conformation of tubulin in neurons both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. Anterograde velocities negatively correlate with the density of elongated tubulin dimers like guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin. The impact of the tubulin conformation depends primarily on where a mitochondrion is positioned, either within or at the rim of microtubule bundle. Increasing elongated tubulin levels lowers the number of motile anterograde mitochondria within the microtubule bundle and increases anterograde transport speed at the microtubule bundle rim. We demonstrate that the increased kinesin velocity and density on microtubules consisting of elongated dimers add to the increased mitochondrial dynamics.

Astrocytic and microglial dysfunction is commonly found in epileptic foci and has been shown to contribute to neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability in chronic epilepsy. Accumulating evidence points to a key role for glial hemichannels in epilepsy, but inhibiting both connexin (Cx) gap junctions and hemichannels can lead to undesirable side effects because the former coordinate physiological functions of cell assemblies. It would be a great benefit to use an orally available small molecule to block hemichannels to alleviate epileptic symptoms. Here, we explored the effect of D4, a newly developed compound that inhibits the Cx hemichannels but not Cx gap junctions using the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE. In vitro application of D4 caused a near-complete reduction in the pilocarpine-induced cell membrane permeability associated with increased Cx hemichannel activity. Moreover, preadministration of D4 in&#160;vivo effectively reduced neuroinflammation and altered synaptic inhibition, which then enhanced the animal survival rate. Posttreatment with a single dose of D4 in&#160;vivo has prolonged effects on suppressing the activation of astrocytes and microglia and rescued the changes in neuroinflammatory and synaptic gene expression induced by pilocarpine.

Entrainment is a widely observed physical phenomenon by which diverse physical systems adjust rhythmic activity through interaction. Here we show that the simple act of infant-directed singing entrains infant social visual behavior on subsecond timescales, increasing infants' looking to the eyes of a singing caregiver: as early as 2 months of age, and doubling in strength by 6 months, infants synchronize their eye-looking to the rhythm of infant-directed singing. Rhythmic entrainment also structures caregivers' own cueing, enhancing their visual display of social-communicative content: caregivers increase wide-eyed positive affect, reduce neutral facial affect, reduce eye motion, and reduce blinking, all in time with the rhythm of their singing and aligned in time with moments when infants increase their eye-looking. In addition, if the rhythm of infant-directed singing is experimentally disrupted-reducing its predictability-then infants' time-locked eye-looking is also disrupted. These results reveal generic processes of entrainment as a fundamental coupling mechanism by which the rhythm of infant-directed singing attunes infants to precisely timed social-communicative content and supports social learning and development.", "query": "no_model"}, "36322750": {"ArticleTitle": "Initial impressions of compatibility and mate value predict later dating and romantic interest.", "AbstractText": "Romantic first impressions seem to linger, but why?

Across three speed-dating studies (<i>n</i> = 559) with longitudinal follow-ups (including college and community samples, and a sample of men who date men), we investigated whether different components of initial romantic impressions predicted later romantic outcomes and relationship initiation. Using the social relations model, we partitioned initial desire at speed dating (determined from 6,600+ total dates) into partner effects (a date's consensual desirability, e.g., mate value), actor effects (a participant's general desirousness, e.g., selectivity), and relationship effects (a participant's unique liking for a date over and beyond partner and actor effects, e.g., compatibility) to predict later evaluations (romantic interest, physical attraction, and desire to know better) and behaviors (direct messaging and going on dates). Meta-analyses across the three studies showed that, across 6,100+ follow-up reports, partner and relationship effects were especially strong predictors of relationship initiation variables.

In machine learning, such noise injection is commonly used as a regularization technique. Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting training data and allow models to generalize learning to new, unseen data. Using a computational modeling approach, here we ask whether a neurogenesis-like process similarly acts as a regularizer, facilitating generalization in a category learning task. In a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset, we modeled neurogenesis as a replacement/turnover mechanism, where weights for a randomly chosen small subset of hidden layer neurons were reinitialized to new values as the model learned to categorize 10 different classes of objects. We found that neurogenesis enhanced generalization on unseen test data compared to networks with no neurogenesis.

Using time-gated stimulated emission-depletion microscopy at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction, we found that presynaptic nanorings formed by the active-zone scaffold Bruchpilot (Brp) align with postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) rings. Individual rings harbor approximately four transsynaptically aligned Brp-GluR nanocolumns. Similar nanocolumn rings are formed by the presynaptic protein Unc13A and GluRs. Intriguingly, acute GluR impairment triggers transsynaptic nanocolumn formation on the minute timescale during homeostatic plasticity. We reveal distinct phases of structural transsynaptic homeostatic plasticity, with postsynaptic GluR reorganization preceding presynaptic Brp modulation.

How recurrent neural circuits integrate evidence for continuous perceptual judgments is unknown. Here, we show that a continuous bump attractor network can integrate a circular feature, such as stimulus direction, nearly optimally. As required by optimal integration, the population activity of the network unfolds on a two-dimensional manifold, in which the position of the network's activity bump tracks the stimulus average, and, simultaneously, the bump amplitude tracks stimulus uncertainty. Moreover, the temporal weighting of sensory evidence by the network depends on the relative strength of the stimulus compared to the internally generated bump dynamics, yielding either early (primacy), uniform, or late (recency) weighting. The model can flexibly switch between these regimes by changing a single control parameter, the global excitatory drive. We show that this mechanism can quantitatively explain individual temporal weighting profiles of human observers, and we validate the model prediction that temporal weighting impacts reaction times.

Previous evidence has shown that both these areas display a number of anomalies affecting neuron and glial cell proliferation and differentiation, which largely anticipate cellular changes and clinical signs, raising our interest on how microglia interplay to these changes.

Enhanced phagocytosis associates with a profound remodeling of gene expression signatures towards gene products involved in chemotaxis, cell recognition and engulfment, including Cd68 and Trem2.

A combination of risk factors (e.g., longer time since kidney transplantation, longer dialysis duration and late CKD onset) was significantly associated with lower intelligence and/or worse processing speed and working memory. Lower FA in a cluster of white matter tracts was associated with lower intelligence and mediated the relation between clinical risk factors and lower intelligence. Young severe CKD patients with a prolonged duration of kidney replacement therapy, either dialysis or transplantation are at particular risk for impairments in intelligence, processing speed, and working memory.

A total of 35 very preterm neonates (24-32 weeks' gestation) were recruited in 2017 and 2018, and neuroimaging was performed and buccal swab samples were acquired at 2 time points: the first in early life (median postmenstrual age, 32.9 weeks [IQR, 32.0-35.0 weeks]) and the second at term-equivalent age (TEA) at a median postmenstrual age of 43.0 weeks (IQR, 41.0-46.0 weeks). Follow-ups for neurodevelopmental assessments were completed in 2019 and 2020. All neonates in this cohort had at least 1 infection because they were originally enrolled to assess the association of neonatal infection with neurodevelopment. Neonates with congenital malformations, genetic syndromes, or congenital TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes and other agents) infection were excluded. The extent of prematurity was measured by gestational age at birth and PedBE age difference. PedBE age was computed using DNA methylation obtained from 94 age-informative CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanosine) sites. PedBE age difference (weeks) was calculated by subtracting PedBE age at each time point from the corresponding postmenstrual age. Total cerebral volumes and cerebral growth during the neonatal intensive care unit period were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 time points: approximately the first 2 weeks of life and at TEA.

Dark exposure initiates homeostatic mechanisms that together with light-induced changes in cellular signaling pathways result in the re-engagement of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult such that previously deprived inputs can gain cortical territory. It is possible that dark exposure itself degrades visual responses, and this could place constraints on the optimal duration of dark exposure treatment. To determine whether eight days of dark exposure has a lasting negative impact on responses to classic grating stimuli, neural activity was recorded before and after dark exposure in awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Neural discriminability, assessed using classifiers, was transiently reduced following dark exposure; a decrease in response reliability across a broad range of spatial frequencies likely contributed to the disruption. Both discriminability and reliability recovered. Fixed classifiers were used to demonstrate that stimulus representation rebounded to the original, pre-deprivation state, thus dark exposure did not appear to have a lasting negative impact on visual processing. Unexpectedly, we found that dark exposure significantly stabilized orientation preference and signal correlation.

Here, we investigated the anatomical and functional consequences of respiratory circuit formation in the absence of microglia. We first established the normal distribution of microglia within the wild-type (WT, Spi1+/+ (Pu.1 WT)) mouse (Mus musculus) brainstem at embryonic ages when the respiratory networks are known to emerge (embryonic day (E) 14.5 for the parafacial respiratory group (epF) and E16.5 for the preB&#246;tzinger complex (preB&#246;tC)). In transgenic mice depleted of microglia (Spi1-/- (Pu.1 KO) mutant), we performed anatomical staining, calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activities in vitro to assess the status of these circuits at their respective times of functional emergence. Spontaneous respiratory-related activity recorded from reduced in vitro preparations showed an abnormally slow rhythm frequency expressed by the epF at E14.5, the preB&#246;tC at E16.5, and in the phrenic motor nerves from E16.5 onwards. These deficits were associated with a reduced number of active epF neurons, defects in commissural projections that couple the bilateral preB&#246;tC half-centers, and an accompanying decrease in their functional coordination. These abnormalities probably contribute to eventual neonatal death, since plethysmography revealed that E18.5 Spi1-/- embryos are unable to sustain breathing activity ex utero.

However, our knowledge of microbial fine structure is still limited, leaving open the possibility of structurally homologous ICMs outside the Alphaproteobacteria. Here, we report on the detailed characterization of lamellar cristae-like ICMs in environmental sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterota that form syntrophic partnerships with anaerobic methane-oxidizing (ANME) archaea. These structures are junction-bound to the cytoplasmic membrane and resemble the form seen in the lamellar cristae of opisthokont mitochondria. Extending these observations, we also characterized similar structures in Desulfovibrio carbinolicus, a close relative of the magnetotactic D. magneticus, which does not contain magnetosomes. Despite a remarkable structural similarity, the key proteins involved in cristae formation have not yet been identified in Desulfobacterota, suggesting that an analogous, but not a homologous, protein organization system developed during the evolution of some members of Desulfobacterota. IMPORTANCE Working with anaerobic consortia of methane oxidizing ANME archaea and their sulfate-reducing bacterial partners recovered from deep sea sediments and with the related sulfate-reducing bacterial isolate D. carbinolicus, we discovered that their intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs) appear remarkably similar to lamellar cristae. Three-dimensional electron microscopy allowed for the novel analysis of the nanoscale attachment of ICMs to the cytoplasmic membrane, and these ICMs are structurally nearly identical to the crista junction architecture seen in metazoan mitochondria. However, the core junction-forming proteins must be different. The outer membrane vesicles were observed to bud from syntrophic Desulfobacterota, and darkly stained granules were prominent in both Desulfobacterota and D. carbinolicus.

Rats responded to Go! cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions on trials when a Stop! cue might occur. This action restraint - visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times - altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the Go! cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. SNr neurons also showed more variable inter-spike-intervals during proactive inhibition. This corresponded to more variable state-space trajectories, which may slow reaction times via reduced preparation to move.

Previously, we showed that a pro/anti-pointing instruction influences magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals in frontal cortex that then propagate recurrently through parietal cortex (Blohm et al., 2019). Here, we contrasted left versus right hand pointing in the same task to investigate 1) which cortical regions of interest show hand specificity, and 2) which of those areas interact with the instructed motor plan.

M1, SMG, SPOC, and aIPS showed significant interactions between contralateral hand specificity and the instructed motor plan, but not with bottom-up target signals. Separate hand / motor signals emerged relatively early and lasted through execution, whereas hand-motor interactions only occurred close to movement onset.

We developed a statistical method (based on a point process model) of determining, accurately, the time of the maximum (peak) population firing rate on a trial-by-trial basis and used it to characterize burst propagation across areas.

In the data we examined, from the Allen Brain Observatory, we found many very strong correlations (95\\% confidence intervals above .75) in cases where standard methods were unable to demonstrate cross-area correlation. The statistical model introduced cross-area covariation only through population-level trial-dependent time shifts and gain constants (values of which were learned from the data), yet it provided very good fits to data histograms, including histograms of spike count correlations within and across visual areas.

Our results reveal clear and systematic variations in the synchrony and strength of functional interactions within single cortical columns. Despite neurons residing within the same column, both measures of interactions depended heavily on the vertical distance separating neuronal pairs, as well as on the similarity of stimulus tuning.

A narrative summary of the contents of the book according to five major issues. An extensive amount of epidemiological evidence shows that alcohol is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, disability and death in high-, middle- and low-income countries. Trends in alcohol products and marketing are described, indicating that a large part of the global industry has been consolidated into a small number of transnational corporations that are expanding their operations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The main part of the book is devoted to a review of strategies and interventions designed to prevent or minimize alcohol-related harm. Overall, the most effective strategies to protect public health are taxation that decreases affordability and restrictions on the physical availability of alcohol. A total ban on alcohol marketing is also an effective strategy to reduce consumption. In addition, drink-driving counter-measures, brief interventions with at-risk drinkers and treatment of drinkers with alcohol dependence are effective in preventing harm in high-risk contexts and groups of hazardous drinkers. Alcohol policy is often the product of competing interests, values and ideologies, with the evidence suggesting that the conflicting interests between profit and health mean that working in partnership with the alcohol industry is likely to lead to ineffective policy.

The actions of serotonin are terminated by active transport of serotonin back into the releasing neuron, which is mediated by the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Because SERT is expressed pre-synaptically and is widely thought to be the only serotonin transporter in the forebrain, the conventional model does not include serotonin transport into post-synaptic neurons. However, a large body of evidence accumulating since the 1970s has shown that serotonin, despite having a positive charge, can cross cell membranes through a diffusion-like process. Multiple low-affinity, high-capacity, sodium-independent transporters, widely expressed in the brain, allow the carrier-mediated diffusion of serotonin into forebrain neurons. The amount of serotonin crossing cell membranes through this mechanism under physiological conditions is considerable. Most prominent textbooks fail to include this alternative method of serotonin uptake in the brain, and even most neuroscientists are unaware of it.

The median dose was 30.3 Gy (range 12.5-52 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range 1-20 fractions). The median biologically effective dose was 44.8 Gy10 (range 14.4-112.5 Gy10). Actuarial rates of postradiotherapy pain relief and radiological response were 87% (95% CI 84%-90%) and 70% (95% CI 65%-75%), respectively. Radiation-related adverse events and vertebral fractures had actuarial rates of 8% (95% CI 5%-11%) and 16% (95% CI 10%-23%), respectively, with fracture rates significantly higher after stereotactic radiotherapy (p = 0.033). Fifty-eight patients (27.6%) had local recurrences after a median of 6.8 months (range 0.1-59 months), with pooled local control rates of 61.6% at 6 months and 40.8% at 12 months, and there were no significant differences based on radiotherapy type (p = 0.068). The median survival was 6 months (range 0.1-62 months), with pooled rates of 52.5% at 6 months and 23.4% at 12 months. Radiotherapy in spine metastatic HCCs shows favorable rates of pain relief, radiological responses, and local control.

Elucidating the ischemic cascade, which within minutes leads to irreversible tissue damage induced by anoxic depolarization (AD), must be a principal focus. Our data show that tonic, extrasynaptic glutamate supplied by system xc - synergizes with ischemia-induced synaptic glutamate release to propagate AD and exacerbate depolarizing waves. Exploiting the role of system xc - and its obligate release of ambient glutamate, therefore, could be a novel therapeutic direction to attenuate the deleterious effects of acute stroke. In stroke, the sudden deprivation of oxygen to neurons triggers a profuse release of glutamate which induces anoxic depolarization (AD) and leads to rapid cell death. Importantly, the latency of the glutamate-driven AD event largely dictates subsequent tissue damage. Although the contribution of synaptic glutamate during ischemia is well-studied, the role of tonic (ambient) glutamate has received far less scrutiny. The majority of tonic, non-synaptic glutamate in the brain is governed by the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xc - . Employing hippocampal slice electrophysiology, we showed that transgenic mice lacking a functional system xc - display longer latencies to AD and altered depolarizing waves compared to WT mice after total oxygen deprivation. Experiments which pharmacologically inhibited system xc - , as well as those manipulating tonic glutamate levels and those antagonizing glutamate receptors, revealed that the antiporter's putative effect on ambient glutamate precipitates the ischemic cascade. As such, the current study yields novel insight into the pathogenesis of acute stroke and may direct future therapeutic interventions. Abstract figure legend Tonic, extrasynaptic glutamate synergizes with synaptically-released glutamate to propagate anoxic depolarization (AD). Mice lacking system xc - (xCT-/- ), an astrocytic glutamate antiporter, exhibit 60-80% lower tonic extracellular glutamate concentrations compared to WT controls. Under anoxic challenge, WT mice experience excessive presynaptic (Pre) glutamate release, which synergizes with extrasynaptic glutamate to rapidly flood the extracellular space. This activates postsynaptic (Post) AMPA and NMDA receptors, thus precipitating AD, enhancing depolarizing AD waves, and provoking the loss of membrane potentials. Despite a greater abundance of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, these ischemia-driven events are significantly mitigated in xCT-/- mice due to the decrement of tonic glutamate. This ultimately reduces the accumulation of extracellular glutamate during anoxia, delays AD, and attenuates depolarizing AD waves in xCT-/- mice. Importantly, both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of system xc - produce this ischemic neuroprotection. This article is protected by copyright.

Speech is the expression of thoughts in spoken words. Language is the principal method that&#160;humans use for relaying information; consisting of words conveyed by speech, writing, or gestures. Language is the conceptual processing of communication. Problems in communication or oral motor function are called speech and language disorders. Developmental delay is diagnosed when a child does not attain normal developmental milestones at the expected age. Speech and/or language disorders are amongst the most common developmental difficulties in childhood. Such difficulties are termed 'primary' if they have no known etiology, and 'secondary' if they are caused by another condition such as hearing and neurological impairment, and developmental, behavioral, or emotional difficulties. Objectives The objective of our study was to observe the risk factors for speech and language delay in the children presenting to the speech therapy clinic of a tertiary care hospital in a large urban center. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted on 150 children presenting at the speech therapy clinic of Lahore General Hospital from July to August 2021. A well-designed questionnaire was used to collect data about the sociodemographic profile, and biological, developmental, and environmental risk factors of speech and language delay in children.

Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) month occurred during the 2nd month of confinement. Compared to pre-confinement, significant changes were registered for almost all parameters during the 1st and/or the 2nd month of confinements (p<0.001), with (i) higher values for resting heart rate, sleep latency, and total, light and rapid eye movements sleep times (% change=7-523 %), and (ii) lower values for PA parameters, calories/day spent, average and highest respiratory rates, and deep sleep time during the home confinement period (% change=5-36 %). During the post-confinement month, all parameters regained pre-confinement values.

Type D is also linked to psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and depression. One mechanism through which personality temperament may result in these psychopathologies is avoidance. Recently, a computer-based measure designed to assess avoidant behaviors, in which the participant guides the behavior of an avatar interacting with strangers in social situations, has been found to be related to various forms of avoidance. In the current study, we extended this work with the avatar avoidance task to determine its relationship to distressed (Type D) personality. We hypothesized that Type D personality, along with SI, but not NA, would be positively related to avatar avoidance scores. We also hypothesized that avatar avoidance scores would be higher in Type D individuals than non-Type D individuals. A total of 302 undergraduates completed the Distressed Type D Personality Scale (DS-14), and a computer-based avatar avoidance task. Type D and SI, and NA to a lesser degree, were positively correlated with avoidance scores on the avatar task. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that Type D and SI scores were best predicted by a model including avoidance scores and education level while NA scores were best predicted by a model including avoidance scores. Standard cut-off scores on the DS-14 scale resulted in four groups (i.e., low SI and NA, high SI, high NA, and Type D) which significantly differed in avoidance scores. Specifically, Type D individuals had higher avoidance scores than the other three groups. Taken together these findings support a role for avoidance in Type D personality. The computer-based avatar avoidance task may be particularly relevant as an ecologically valid measure to identify avoidance in a virtual setting for use with individuals expressing Type D personality who may be unwilling or unable to accurately self-report or describe their own avoidant tendencies.", "query": "no_model"}, "36320423": {"ArticleTitle": "Efficacy and Safety of Lower-Sodium Oxybate in an Open-Label Titration Period of a Phase 3 Clinical Study in Adults with Idiopathic Hypersomnia.", "AbstractText": "To report the efficacy and safety of lower-sodium oxybate (LXB; Xywav&#174;) during the open-label titration and optimization period (OLT) and stable-dose period (SDP) in a clinical study for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.

Restoration of human FMRP in appropriate cell types and at physiological levels, preferably driven by the human FMR1 promoter, would be more suitable for its clinical use. Herein, we generated two human FMR1 promoter subdomains that effectively drive gene expression. When AAVs expressing two different human FMRP isoforms under the control of a human FMR1 promoter subdomain were administered into bilateral ventricles of neonatal Fmr1 -/y and wild-type (WT) mice, both human FMRP isoforms were expressed throughout the brain in a pattern reminiscent to that of mouse FMRP. Importantly, human FMRP expression attenuated social behavior deficits and stereotyped and repetitive behavior, and reversed dysmorphological dendritic spines in Fmr1 -/y mice, without affecting WT mouse behaviors.

Using longitudinal developmental fMRI with an n-back paradigm, we show a heterogeneity of maturational changes in multivoxel activity and network connectivity among DMN and FPN nodes in 528 children and 103 young adults. Compared with adults, children exhibited prominent longitudinal improvement but still inferior behavioral performance, which paired with less pronounced DMN deactivation and weaker FPN activation in children, but stronger DMN coupling with FPN regions. Children's DMN reached an adult-like level earlier than FPN at both multivoxel activity pattern and intranetwork connectivity levels. Intrinsic DMN-FPN internetwork coupling in children mediated the relationship between age and working memory-related functional coupling of these networks, with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) coupling emerging as most prominent pathway.

However, it is not clear how the timing of neural processing differs between \"darks\" and \"brights\" in general, especially in light of psychophysical evidence; it is also equally not clear how subcortical visual pathways that are critical for active orienting represent stimuli of positive (luminance increments) and negative (luminance decrements) contrast polarity. Here, we recorded from all visually-responsive neuron types in the superior colliculus (SC) of two male rhesus macaque monkeys. We presented a disc (0.51 deg radius) within the response fields (RF's) of neurons, and we varied, across trials, stimulus Weber contrast relative to a gray background. We also varied contrast polarity. There was a large diversity of preferences for darks and brights across the population. However, regardless of individual neural sensitivity, most neurons responded significantly earlier to dark than bright stimuli. This resulted in a dissociation between neural preference and visual response onset latency: a neuron could exhibit a weaker response to a dark stimulus than to a bright stimulus of the same contrast, but it would still have an earlier response to the dark stimulus. Our results highlight an additional candidate visual neural pathway for explaining behavioral differences between the processing of darks and brights, and they demonstrate the importance of temporal aspects in the visual neural code for orienting eye movements.Significance statement:Objects in our environment, such as birds flying across a bright sky, often project shadows (or images darker than the surround) on our retina. We studied how primate superior colliculus (SC) neurons visually process such dark stimuli. We found that the overall population of SC neurons represented both dark and bright stimuli equally well, as evidenced by a relatively equal distribution of neurons that were either more or less sensitive to darks.

However, the cephalopod brain is organized dramatically differently from that of vertebrates and invertebrates, and beyond neuroanatomical descriptions, little is known regarding the cell types and molecular determinants of their visual system organization. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell molecular atlas of the octopus optic lobe, which is the primary visual processing structure in the cephalopod brain. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to both identify putative molecular cell types and determine their anatomical and spatial organization within the optic lobe. Our results reveal six major neuronal cell classes identified by neurotransmitter/neuropeptide usage, in addition to non-neuronal and immature neuronal populations. We find that additional markers divide these neuronal classes into subtypes with distinct anatomical localizations, revealing further diversity and a detailed laminar organization within the optic lobe. We also delineate the immature neurons within this continuously growing tissue into subtypes defined by evolutionarily conserved developmental genes as well as novel cephalopod- and octopus-specific genes. Together, these findings outline the organizational logic of the octopus visual system, based on functional determinants, laminar identity, and developmental markers/pathways.

When the ponds are flooded, eggs hatch synchronously, enabling a precise timing of their individual and population age. We collected the brains of wild fish of different ages and quantified the global age-dependent regulation of transcripts using RNAseq. A major difference between captive and wild populations is that wild populations had unlimited access to food and hence grew to larger sizes and reached asymptotic size more rapidly, enabling the analysis of age-dependent gene expression without the confounding effect of adult brain growth. We found that the majority of differentially expressed genes show the same direction of regulation in wild and captive populations. However, a number of genes were regulated in opposite direction. Genes downregulated in the wild and upregulated in captivity were enriched for terms related to neuronal communication.

The study provides further support for the notion that examining the ability to alter responsiveness to structured sound sequences in schizophrenia and first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum could be informative to uncovering the nature and progression of changes in brain function during the illness.

We sought to identify novel de novo sequence variants in cases with early infantile epileptic phenotypes and neurodevelopmental anomalies. Following clinical diagnosis, we performed whole exome sequencing of the index cases and their parents. Identified channel variants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their functional properties assessed using two-electrode voltage-clamp. We identified novel de novo variants in KCNA6 in four unrelated individuals variably affected with neurodevelopmental disorders and seizures with onset in the first year of life. Three of the four identified mutations affect pore lining S6 &#945;-helix of KV 1.6. Prominent finding of functional characterisation in Xenopus oocytes was that the channel variants showed only minor effects on channel activation but slowed channel closure and shifted the voltage dependence of deactivation in a hyperpolarizing direction. Channels with a mutation affecting the S6 helix display dominant effects on channel deactivation when co-expressed with wild-type KV 1.6 or KV 1.1 subunits. This is the first report of de novo non-synonymous variants in KCNA6 associated with neurological or any clinical features. Channel variants showed a consistent effect on channel deactivation, slowing the rate of channel closure following normal activation. This specific gain-of-function feature is likely to underlie the neurological phenotype in our patients.

Our primary hypothesis was seizure freedom one-year after MRgLITT was noninferior to open surgery in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The secondary hypothesis was MRgLITT has fewer complications and shorter hospitalization than surgery. The primary objective was to compare seizure outcome of MRgLITT to open surgery in children with DRE. The secondary objective was to compare complications and length of hospitalization of the two treatments. This retrospective multi-center cohort study included children with DRE treated with MRgLITT or open surgery with one-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria were corpus callosotomy, neurostimulation, multilobar or hemispheric surgery and lesion with maximal dimension greater than 60&#8201;mm. MRgLITT were propensity matched to open surgery patients. The primary outcome was seizure freedom one-year post treatment. The difference in seizure freedom was compared using noninferiority test, with noninferiority margin of -10%. The secondary outcomes were complications and length of hospitalization. 185 MRgLITT patients were matched to 185 open surgery patients. Seizure freedom at one-year follow-up was observed in 89/185 (48.1%) MRgLITT and 114/185 (61.6%) open surgery patients (difference= -13.5%, one-sided 97.5%CI: -23.8% to &#8734;, PNoninferiority =0.79).

Consecutive infants at a single institution with antenatally diagnosed TSC who met criteria for prolonged video-EEG (vEEG) were recruited to this study. The vEEG data was reviewed and when a seizure was identified on EEG, the video and audio recording was assessed for evidence of clinical seizure and if present whether there was evidence of parent seizure identification. Nine infants were enrolled, for whom 674 focal seizures were identified in 8/9 patients across 24 prolonged vEEG recordings, with vEEG total duration 634 hours 49 minutes (average seizure frequency of 1 focal seizure/hour). Only 220/674 (32.6%) were clinical seizures, 395/674 (58.6%) were subclinical seizures and 59/674 seizures were unable to be classified. Only 63/220 (28.6%) clinical seizures were identified by parents, with 157/220 (71.4%) not identified. Thirty clusters of epileptic spasms were detected in 1 patient. At least one clinical epileptic spasm occurred in 2/30 (6.7%) clusters, 24/30 (80%) clusters of epileptic spasms were electrographic only, and classification was uncertain for 4/30 (13.3%) clusters. No clinical epileptic spasms were detected by parents. Clinical seizure frequency was significantly under-estimated by parents in all patients. This study demonstrates that in TSC infants meeting criteria for prolonged vEEG, that 1) parents significantly under-identify total clinical seizure count, 2) parents fail to identify epileptic spasms and 3) that seizure frequency is high. This highlights that epilepsy treatment decisions should not be solely based on parental clinical seizure identification. Prolonged vEEG monitoring may have an important role in the routine epilepsy care of TSC infants, as demonstrating undetected high clinical seizure frequency may allow improved epilepsy management decisions.", "query": "no_model"}, "36317965": {"ArticleTitle": "Molecular and anatomical characterization of parabrachial neurons and their axonal projections.", "AbstractText": "The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is a major hub that receives sensory information from both internal and external environments.

We addressed whether collective dynamics play a role in human circle drumming. The task was to synchronize in a group with an initial reference pattern and then maintain synchronization after it was muted. We varied the number of drummers, from solo to dyad, quartet, and octet. The observed lower variability, lack of speeding up, smoother individual dynamics, and leader-less inter-personal coordination indicated that stability increased as group size increased, a sort of temporal wisdom of crowds.

Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of kiaa1024L/minar2 reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles.

Healthy volunteers (n = 40) were either instructed about contingencies between cues and aversive outcomes or learned through experience in a paradigm where contingencies reversed three times. We measured predictive cue effects on pain and heat-evoked brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Predictive cues dynamically modulated pain perception as contingencies changed, regardless of whether participants received contingency instructions. Heat-evoked responses in the insula, anterior cingulate, and other regions updated as contingencies changed, and responses in the prefrontal cortex mediated dynamic cue effects on pain, whereas responses in the brainstem's rostroventral medulla (RVM) were shaped by initial contingencies throughout the task. Quantitative modeling revealed that expected value was shaped purely by instructions in the Instructed Group, whereas expected value updated dynamically in the Uninstructed Group as a function of error-based learning. These differences were accompanied by dissociations in the neural correlates of value-based learning in the rostral anterior cingulate, thalamus, and posterior insula, among other regions. These results show how predictions dynamically impact subjective pain. Moreover, imaging data delineate three types of networks involved in pain generation and value-based learning: those that respond to initial contingencies, those that update dynamically during feedback-driven learning as contingencies change, and those that are sensitive to instruction.

Next, we assessed whether overlapping networks captured expected nonoverlapping topographies; overlapping networks captured portions of one to three nonoverlapping topographies, which aligned with canonical network definitions. Following this, a relative entropy analysis showed that a majority of regions participated in more than one network, as is seen biologically, and many regions did not show preferential connection to any one network.

Part of the challenge is there exist many different types of attention, which may or may not share common mechanisms. Here we review this literature and offer an intuitive definition that draws from aspects of prior theories and models of attention but is broad enough to recognize the various types of attention and modalities it acts upon: attention as a multi-level system of weights and balances. While the specific mechanism(s) governing the weighting/balancing may vary across levels, the fundamental role of attention is to dynamically weigh and balance all signals-both externally-generated and internally-generated-such that the highest weighted signals are selected and enhanced. Top-down, bottom-up, and experience-driven factors dynamically impact this balancing, and competition occurs both within and across multiple levels of processing. This idea of a multi-level system of weights and balances is intended to incorporate both external and internal attention and capture their myriad of constantly interacting processes. We review key findings and open questions related to external attention guidance, internal attention and working memory, and broader attentional control (e.g., ongoing competition between external stimuli and internal thoughts) within the framework of this analogy. We also speculate about the implications of failures of attention in terms of weights and balances, ranging from momentary one-off errors to clinical disorders, as well as attentional development and degradation across the lifespan.

This phenomenon is called the left visual field bias (LVF) and is presumed to reflect the brain's right-sided dominance for face processing. Whether alterations in hemispheric dominance are present in dyslexia, and are linked with individual differences in word reading development more generally, is still unclear, and no prior research has utilized gaze-based LVF bias to explore these topics. The aim of the study was to examine whether the LVF bias differs in dyslexia and to examine the association with word-reading skills assessed dimensionally. Forty-six 9-13 year-old children with dyslexia and community control children, matched on age and listening comprehension. Participants were presented with a recorded face on a screen while their gaze patterns were collected with an eye tracker. Fixations to the left versus the right side of the face stimuli were compared. Results showed a clear LVF bias in community controls, while no such bias was seen in the dyslexic group. Moreover, the strength of the LVF bias was correlated with better word reading in the controls. Our results suggest a link between weakened hemispheric dominance for face processing in dyslexia and in poor word reading, at least to the extent that the LVF bias actually mirrors underlying physiology. We discuss the implications of these novel findings, highlighting the need for future research to determine the specificity and developmental sources of LVF bias alterations.", "query": "no_model"}, "36317186": {"ArticleTitle": "A transitive perspective on the relief of psychosomatic symptoms.", "AbstractText": "A key element of successful psychotherapy for the treatment of psychosomatic disorders is that patients recognize and change the meaning of their experiences.

The present theoretical paper argues that changes are not based on better, more adaptive narratives per se, but on the transition (or linkage) process itself that is experienced between different narratives. This view is theoretically justified in various ways: first, it is accounted for through contemporary spatiotemporal neuroscience, which aims to connect mental and structural aspects via a common dynamic property or, according to Northoff, the \"common currency\" of a brain's orientation along its embeddedness in its contextual world, i.e., body and environment. Second, it is justified through the physics concept of \"spontaneous symmetry breaking,\" which is used analogously to \"suffering from symptoms.\" If the sufferer is willing to experience a process of \"going back,\" that is, moving away from the previous narrative (or aspect) by verbally relating to the felt aspects of the symptom in question (i.e., approaching its meaning), they are moving toward symmetry or an underlying dynamic alignment with their world context.

Here, we aim to study the converged brain regions of functional and structural abnormalities in gray matter volume (GMV) associated with pain processing and management in migraineurs and healthy controls (HC). A systematic search through PubMed and Sleuth was carried out for peer-reviewed functional and structural neuroimaging studies on migraine patients and HC yielded a total of 1136 studies. We performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on VBM and pain stimulation task-based fMRI studies to investigate the converged areas of GMV and functional abnormalities between migraineurs and HC. We performed two subgroup analyses between migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA) relative to HC, and between chronic migraine (CM) and episodic migraine (EM) compared to HC. The total sample included 16 fMRI and 22 VBM studies, consisting of 1295 migraine patients, compared to 995 HC. In fMRI analysis, ALE maps for pain stimulation tasks revealed hyperactivation in migraineurs in the substantia nigra compared to HC, whereas hypoactivation was seen in the cerebellum. For the VBM analysis, ALE clusters of increased GMV in migraineurs were observed in the parahippocampus and putamen nucleus.

Thus, although glia and neurons are similarly abundant in the nervous systems of humans and most animal models, glia have traditionally been much less represented than neurons in morphological reconstruction repositories such as NeuroMorpho.Org. This is rapidly changing with the advent of high-throughput glia tracing. NeuroMorpho.Org introduced glial cells in 2017 and today they constitute nearly a third of the database content. It took NeuroMorpho.Org 10 years to collect the first 40,000 neurons and now that amount of data can be produced in a single publication.

At the same time, these publicly available data also open new opportunities for quantitative analysis and computational modeling to identify universal or cell-type-specific design principles in the cellular architecture of nervous systems.

In this review, the potential role of autophagy induced by FLT3-ITD and acid ceramidase in chemo-resistance in AML patients are analyzed. With regard to the high prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutation (about 25% of AML cases) and high level of acid ceramidase in these patients, we hypothesized that both of these factors could lead to chemo-resistance by inducing autophagy. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of autophagy, FLT3-ITD, and acid ceramidase production could be a promising therapeutic approach for such AML patients to overcome chemo-resistance.

Individual and public health, and socioeconomic consequences are attributable to harmful alcohol use. Epidemiological studies have shown that alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are the top two pathologies among alcohol-related diseases. Consistent with the major role that the liver plays in alcohol metabolism, uncontrolled drinking may cause significant damage to the liver. This damage is initiated with excessive fat accumulation in the liver, which can further progress to advanced liver disease. The only effective therapeutic strategies currently available for ALD are alcohol abstinence or liver transplantation. Any molecule with dual pronged effects at the central and peripheral organs controlling addictive behaviors and associated metabolic pathways could be a promising therapeutic target to treat AUD and ALD. Ghrelin, a hormone primarily derived from the stomach, has such properties and regulates both behavioral and metabolic functions. In this review, we highlight recent advances in understanding the peripheral and central functions of the ghrelin system and its role in AUD and ALD pathogenesis. We first discuss the correlation between blood ghrelin concentrations and alcohol use or abstinence. Next, we discuss the role of ghrelin in alcohol-seeking behaviors, and finally its role in development of fatty liver by metabolic regulations and organ-crosstalk.

NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A&#946;) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A&#946;-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A&#946; plaques (average age of death of 83.1&#160;yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001).

Retrospective cohort study of two patient populations - namely, hospital patients admitted to four UK acute hospitals located in Oxfordshire, and participants of the BP in different ethnic groups (BP-Eth) study, who were recruited from 28 UK general practices in the West Midlands. Using BP data collected for the two cohorts, three systolic BP phenotypes (dipper, non-dipper, and reverse dipper) were studied. Among the hospital cohort, 48.9% ( n = 10 610/21 716) patients were 'reverse dippers', with an average day-night systolic BP difference of +8.0 mmHg. Among the community (BP-Eth) cohort, 10.8% ( n = 63/585) of patients were reverse dippers, with an average day-night systolic BP difference of +8.5 mmHg.

Electrophysiological abnormalities including low-frequency activity are common following TBI. Here, we investigate associative memory binding during PTA and test the hypothesis that misbinding is caused by pathological slowing of brain activity disrupting cortical communication. Thirty acute moderate-severe TBI patients (25 males; 5 females) and 26 healthy controls (20 males; 6 females) were tested with a precision working memory paradigm requiring the association of object and location information. Electrophysiological effects of TBI were assessed using resting-state EEG in a subsample of 17 patients and 21 controls. PTA patients showed abnormalities in working memory function and made significantly more misbinding errors than patients who were not in PTA and controls. The distribution of localisation responses was abnormally biased by the locations of non-target items for patients in PTA suggesting a specific impairment of object and location binding. Slow wave activity was increased following TBI. Increases in the delta-alpha ratio indicative of an increase in low-frequency power specifically correlated with binding impairment in working memory. Connectivity changes in TBI did not correlate with binding impairment. Working memory and electrophysiological abnormalities normalised at six-month follow-up. These results show that patients in PTA show high rates of misbinding that are associated with a pathological shift towards lower frequency oscillations.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:How do we remember what was where? The mechanism by which information e.g., object and location is integrated in working memory is a central question for cognitive neuroscience. Following significant head injury, many patients will experience a period of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) during which this associative binding is disrupted. This may be due to electrophysiological changes in the brain. Using a precision working memory test and resting-state EEG we show that PTA patients demonstrate impaired binding ability, and this is associated with a shift towards slower frequency activity on EEG. Abnormal EEG connectivity was observed but was not specific to PTA or binding ability.

At this point, it is clear that this process is strongly influenced by prior knowledge of the sensory environment. Bayesian ideal observer models provide a key link between data and theory that can help researchers evaluate how prior knowledge is represented and integrated with incoming sensory information. However, the statistical prior employed by a Bayesian observer cannot be measured directly, and must instead be inferred from behavioral measurements. Here we review the general problem of inferring priors from psychophysical data, and the simple solution that follows from assuming a prior that is a Gaussian probability distribution. As our understanding of sensory processing advances, however, there is an increasing need for methods to flexibly recover the shape of Bayesian priors that are not well-approximated by elementary functions. To address this issue, we describe a novel approach that applies to arbitrary prior shapes, which we parameterize using mixtures of Gaussian distributions. After incorporating a simple approximation, this method produces an analytical solution for psychophysical quantities that can be numerically optimized to recover the shapes of Bayesian priors. This approach offers advantages in flexibility, while still providing an analytical framework for many scenarios. We provide a MATLAB toolbox implementing key computations described herein.Significance statementModels in neuroscience provide an essential tool for developing and testing hypotheses about how the brain works.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are bioactive lipids synthesized in the post-synaptic compartments to regulate synaptic transmission, plasticity, and neuronal excitability primarily through retrograde activation of pre-synaptic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). The eCB system is well-situated to regulate neuronal network properties and coordinate pre- and post-synaptic activity. However, the role of the eCB system in homeostatic adaptations to neuronal hyperactivity is unknown. To address this issue, we used western blot and targeted lipidomics to measure adaptations in eCB system to bicuculline (BCC)-induced chronic hyperexcitation in mature (>DIV21) cultured rat cortical neurons, and used multielectrode array recording and live-cell imaging of glutamate dynamics to test the effects of pharmacological manipulations of eCB on network activities. We show that BCC-induced chronic hyperexcitation triggers homeostatic downscaling and a coordinated adaptation to enhance tonic eCB signaling. Hyperexcitation triggers first the downregulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the lipase that degrades the eCB anandamide, then an accumulation of anandamide and related metabolites, and finally a delayed upregulation of surface and total CB1. Additionally, we show that BCC-induced downregulation of surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) and upregulation of CB1 occur through independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that endocannabinoids support baseline network activities before and after downscaling and is engaged to suppress network activity during adaptation to hyperexcitation. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of downscaling and homeostatic regulation of in vitro oscillatory network activities.Significance statementNeurons are remarkably resilient to perturbations in network activities thanks to the expression of overlapping homeostatic adaptations. In response to network hyperactivity or silencing, neurons respond through regulating excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors density, probability of pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release, and/or membrane excitability. The endocannabinoid system is a prominent signaling pathway at many synapses that is known to be involved in multiple forms of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we find that components of the endocannabinoid system are upregulated in response to chronic hyperexcitation of cultured cortical neurons, and that endocannabinoid signaling is required to maintain network activity but also suppresses network events during hyperexcitation.

We used affinity proteomics in neuronally differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) to identify the protein complex associated with KIF1C in neuronal cells; candidate interactions were then validated by immunoprecipitation and mislocalization of putative KIF1C cargoes was studied by immunostainings. We found KIF1C to interact with all core components of the exon junction complex (EJC); expression of mutant KIF1C in neuronal cells leads to loss of the typical localization distally in neurites. Instead, EJC core components accumulate in the pericentrosomal region, here co-localizing with mutant KIF1C. These findings suggest KIF1C as a neuronal transporter of the EJC.

The corresponding differences in recurrent stroke between ticagrelor-aspirin and clopidogrel-aspirin for normal, mildly decreased, and moderately to severely decreased renal function was -2.8 percentage points (95% CI, -4.4 to -1.3 percentage points) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [CI, 0.49 to 0.81]), -0.2 percentage point (CI, -2.4 to 2.0 percentage points) (HR, 0.98 [CI, 0.69 to 1.39]), and 3.7 percentage points (CI, -2.3 to 10.1 percentage points) (HR, 1.31 [CI, 0.48 to 3.55]), respectively. Rates of severe or moderate bleeding did not substantially differ by treatment assignments across eGFR categories. Renal function was only evaluated by using eGFR, and the proportion of patients with severely decreased renal function was low.

ZFYVE26-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP-ZFYVE26, SPG15) is a rare, early-onset complex HSP, characterized by progressive spasticity and a variety of other neurological symptoms. While prior reports, often in populations with high rates of consanguinity, have established a general phenotype, there is a lack of systematic investigations and a limited understanding of age-dependent manifestation of symptoms. Here we delineate the clinical, neuroimaging and molecular features of 44 individuals from 36 families, the largest cohort assembled to date. Median age at last follow-up was 23.8 years covering a wide age range (11-61 years). While symptom onset often occurred in early childhood (median: 24 months, IQR&#8201;=&#8201;24), a molecular diagnosis was reached at a median age of 18.8 years (IQR&#8201;=&#8201;8), indicating significant diagnostic delay. We demonstrate that most patients present with motor and/or speech delay or learning disabilities. Importantly, these developmental symptoms preceded the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Progressive spasticity in the lower extremities, the hallmark feature of HSP-ZFYVE26, typically presents in adolescence and involves the distal lower limbs before progressing proximally. Spasticity in the upper extremities was seen in 64%. We found a high prevalence of extrapyramidal movement disorders including cerebellar ataxia (64%) and dystonia (11%). Parkinsonism (16%) was present in a subset and showed no sustained response to levodopa. Cognitive decline and neurogenic bladder dysfunction progressed over time in most patients. A systematic analysis of brain MRI features revealed a common diagnostic signature consisting of thinning of the anterior corpus callosum, signal changes of the anterior forceps, and non-specific cortical and cerebellar atrophy. The molecular spectrum included 45 distinct variants, distributed across the protein structure without mutational hotspots. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) scores, SPATAX Disability Scores and the 4-Stage Functional Mobility Score showed moderate strength in representing the proportion of variation between disease duration and motor dysfunction. Plasma neurofilament light chain levels were significantly elevated in all patients (Mann-Whitney-U test, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001) and were correlated inversely with age (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r&#8201;=&#8201;-0.65, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01).

A major obstacle in this field of research is the difficulty of studying cortical brain development in humans, at the relevant time period in utero. To address this, we established an in vitro assay to study the impact of gene variants on the developing human brain, using living organotypic cultures of the human subplate and neighbouring cortical regions, prepared from ethically sourced, 14-17 post conception week brain tissue (www.hdbr.org). We were able to maintain cultures for several months, during which time, the gross anatomical structures of the cortical plate, subplate and marginal zone persisted, while neurons continued to develop morphologically, and form new synaptic networks. This preparation thus permits the study of genetic manipulations, and their downstream effects upon an intact developing human cortical network. We focused upon STXBP1 haploinsufficiency, which is among the most common genetic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This was induced using shRNA interference, leading to impaired synaptic function and a reduced density of glutamatergic synapses.

We build on compensatory control theory, which suggests that low personal control can lead people to prefer societal systems that impose order, to examine the mutual constitution of personal control and cultural tightness. Specifically, we tested whether individuals' lack of personal control increases their preference for tighter cultures as a means of restoring order and predictability, and whether tighter cultures in turn reduce people's feelings of personal control. Seven studies (five preregistered) with participants from the United States, Singapore, and China examine this cycle of mutual constitution. Specifically, documenting the correlational link between person and culture, we found that Americans lower on personal control preferred to live in tighter states (Study 1). Chinese employees lower on personal control also desired more structure and preferred a tighter organizational culture (Study 2). Employing an experimental causal chain design, Studies 3-5 provided causal evidence for our claim that lack of control increases desire for tighter cultures via the need for structure. Finally, tracing the link back from culture to person, Studies 6a and 6b found that whereas tighter cultures decreased perceptions of individual personal control, they increased people's sense of collective control. Overall, the findings document the process of mutual constitution of culture and psyche: lack of personal control leads people to seek more structured, tighter cultures, and that tighter cultures, in turn, decrease people's sense of personal control but increase their sense of collective control.

This longitudinal, prospective cohort study included 444 patients, (56% female), aged 27-85 years, with at least one metabolic risk factor. Participants were offered PAP by nurses or physiotherapists. The PAP intervention included an individualised dialogue, a PA recommendation by written prescription, and individually adjusted follow-up over 5 years, according to the Swedish PAP model.

Two main forms of beta-amyloid in humans are 40 and 42-amino acid, long; the latter is considered more relevant to AD etiology. The concentration of soluble beta-amyloid-42 (A&#946;42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-A&#946;42) and the density of amyloid depositions have a strong negative correlation. However, AD patients have lower CSF-A&#946;42 levels compared to individuals with normal cognition (NC), even after accounting for this correlation. The goal of this study was to infer deviations of A&#946;42 metabolism parameters that underlie this difference using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. A&#946;42 is released to the interstitial fluid (ISF) by cells and is removed by several processes. First, growth of insoluble fibrils by aggregation decreases the concentration of soluble beta-amyloid in the ISF. Second, A&#946;42 is physically transferred from the brain to the CSF and removed with the CSF flow. Finally, there is an intratissue removal of A&#946;42 ending in proteolysis, which can occur either in the ISF or inside the cells after the peptide is endocytosed. Unlike aggregation, which preserves the peptide in the brain, transfer to the CSF and intratissue proteolysis together represent amyloid removal. Using a kinetic model of A&#946;42 turnover, we found that compared to NC subjects, AD patients had dramatically increased rates of amyloid removal. A group with late-onset mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) also exhibited a higher rate of amyloid removal; however, this was less pronounced than in the AD group. Estimated parameters in the early-onset MCI group did not differ significantly from those in the NC group. We hypothesize that increased amyloid removal is mediated by A&#946;42 cellular uptake; this is because CSF flow is not increased in AD patients, while most proteases are intracellular. A&#946; cytotoxicity depends on both the amount of beta-amyloid internalized by cells and its intracellular conversion into toxic products. We speculate that AD and LMCI are associated with increased cellular amyloid uptake, which leads to faster disease progression. The early-onset MCI (EMCI) patients do not differ from the NC participants in terms of cellular amyloid uptake.

Under physiological conditions, endothelial stimulation induces vasodilator endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) release and prevents adhesion molecule accessibility and leukocyte adhesion and migration into vessel walls. Endothelium dysfunction is a principal event in cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis. Minimal attention is given to an important endothelial cell structure, the endothelial glycocalyx (GCX), a negatively charged heterogeneous polysaccharide that serves as a protective covering for endothelial cells and enables endothelial cells to transduce mechanical stimuli into various biological and chemical activities. Endothelial GCX shedding thus plays a role in endothelial dysfunction, for example by increasing vascular permeability and decreasing vessel tone. Consequently, there is increasing interest in developing therapies that focus on GCX repair to limit downstream endothelium dysfunction and prevent further downstream cardiovascular events. Here, we present diosmin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone-7-rhamnoglucoside), a flavone glycoside of diosmetin, which downregulates adhesive molecule expression, decreases inflammation and capillary permeability, and upregulates eNO expression. Due to these pleiotropic effects of diosmin on the vasculature, a possible unidentified mechanism of action is through GCX restoration. We hypothesize that diosmin positively affects GCX integrity along with GCX-related endothelial functions. Our hypothesis was tested in a partial ligation left carotid artery (LCA) mouse model, where the right carotid artery was the control for each mouse. Diosmin (50&#8201;mg/kg) was administered daily for 7&#8201;days, 72&#160;h after ligation. Within the ligated mice LCAs, diosmin treatment elevated the activated eNO synthase level, inhibited inflammatory cell uptake, decreased vessel wall thickness, increased vessel diameter, and increased GCX coverage of the vessel wall. ELISA showed a decrease in hyaluronan concentration in plasma samples of diosmin-treated mice, signifying reduced GCX shedding. In summary, diosmin supported endothelial GCX integrity, to which we attribute diosmin's preservation of endothelial function as indicated by attenuated expression of inflammatory factors and restored vascular tone.", "query": "no_model"}, "36315158": {"ArticleTitle": "Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms and Disorders in Children and Adolescents With Migraine: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.", "AbstractText": "Though it is presumed that children and adolescents with migraine are at risk of internalizing symptoms and disorders, high-level summative evidence to support this clinical belief is lacking.

Often, children in oncology care are frustrated about their inability to control events and activities around them. Therapeutic pretend play has been suggested as a means to encourage children to express and handle emotions in a safe environment. This study was developed to describe and explore parents' experiences of a pretend play intervention that consisted of six to eight play sessions with a play facilitator administered to their children undergoing cancer treatment. A descriptive qualitative method was used, including individual interviews with 15 parents. Three main categories were developed, including (a) experiences of joining the project, (b) perceptions of the play intervention, and (c) reflections on effects and implications, with subcategories evolved for each category. The parents experienced that the play sessions helped improve their children's communication skills and made them more capable of participating in their care. They appreciated that the intervention focused on the child's well-being and saw it as a positive break in their child's cancer treatment. It also helped them better reflect on their own situation. According to the parents' experiences, pretend play can be a helpful tool for improving children's participation in their cancer care that strengthens their autonomy, emotional repertoire, and communication skills. However, the results also highlighted that some of the children did not fully understand the information provided about this study, which weakened the validity of their consent to participate.

A central theme is the recognition of heterogeneity. Originally construed as a disorder of behaviour and executive impairment, FTD is now known also to be associated with alterations in language, conceptual knowledge and praxis. An absence of neurological signs is the hallmark of many FTD patients, but there is also an established association with motor neurone disease (MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). FTD is commonly defined as an early onset dementia, yet about a quarter of patients present after the age of 65. The underlying pathological protein is tau, TDP-43 or more rarely fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Distinct genetic mutations have been identified in familial FTD. There are predictable relationships between clinical phenotype, pathological substrate and genetic mutation. For example, a circumscribed semantic disorder predicts TDP-43 pathology, and speech or limb apraxia tau pathology. The co-occurrence of MND predicts TDP-43 pathology, and PSP and CBD tau pathology. FUS pathology is associated with very youthful onset, stereotyped behaviours and caudate atrophy. Non-fluent aphasia is linked to progranulin (GRN) mutations and MND and psychosis to repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene. Despite striking worldwide consensus in findings there remain some issues of contention, largely related to the classification of FTD and its sub-variants.

VP shunt failure may occur due to infection, or catheter mispositioning, migration, and occlusion. We undertook a joint neurosurgery and general surgery collaboration in a 7-year prospective non-randomized consecutive quality improvement cohort study to reduce the rates of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt failures in 224 adult patients at a tertiary care institution. The initiative combined the use of electromagnetic stereotactic neuronavigation to guide the placement of the proximal catheter and laparoscopy to place the distal catheter under direct visualization. With laparoscopic assistance, the distal catheter was anchored through a small hole created in the falciform ligament and placed into the right retrohepatic space, free from the omentum, adhesions, or bowel that might obstruct the catheter tip. The surgeries were performed using a shunt infection prevention protocol to reduce the risk of shunt infections. Here, we present an intraoperative video of the surgical procedure.

We studied this question in a grasshopper visual neuron that tracks approaching objects and triggers escape behavior before an impending collision. In response to black approaching objects, the neuron receives OFF excitatory inputs that form a retinotopic map of the visual field onto compartmentalized, distal dendrites. Subsequent processing of these OFF inputs by active membrane conductances allows the neuron to discriminate the spatial coherence of such stimuli. In contrast, we show that ON excitatory synaptic inputs activated by white approaching objects map in a random manner onto a more proximal dendritic field of the same neuron. The lack of retinotopic synaptic arrangement results in the neuron's inability to discriminate the coherence of white approaching stimuli. Yet, the neuron retains the ability to discriminate stimulus coherence for checkered stimuli of mixed ON/OFF polarity. The coarser mapping and processing of ON stimuli thus has a minimal impact, while reducing the total energetic cost of the circuit. Further, we show that these differences in ON/OFF neuronal processing are behaviorally relevant, being tightly correlated with the animal's escape behavior to light and dark stimuli of variable coherence.

We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains, and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons' responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields and thus links this capacity to their terminal organization in the skin.

Therefore, it is not known how post-encoding prioritization and selection operate on the entire profile of representations for prospective actions. Here, we assessed how such control processes unfold over action representations, highlighting the role of conjunctive representations that nonlinearly integrate task-relevant features during maintenance and prioritization of action plans.

However, during output selection, the conjunctive representation of the high priority action plan was more enhanced and readily selected as an output.

Despite this importance, it remains unknown how imagination is realized in the brain. Substantial research focusing on the hippocampus, a brain structure traditionally linked to memory, indicates that firing patterns in spatially tuned neurons can represent previous and upcoming paths in space. This work has generally been interpreted under standard views that the hippocampus implements cognitive abilities primarily related to actual experience, whether in the past (e.g. recollection, consolidation), present (e.g. spatial mapping) or future (e.g. planning). However, relatively recent findings in rodents identify robust patterns of hippocampal firing corresponding to a variety of alternatives to actual experience, in many cases without overt reference to the past, present or future. Given these findings, and others on hippocampal contributions to human imagination, we suggest that a fundamental function of the hippocampus is to generate a wealth of hypothetical experiences and thoughts. Under this view, traditional accounts of hippocampal function in episodic memory and spatial navigation can be understood as particular applications of a more general system for imagination. This view also suggests that the hippocampus contributes to a wider range of cognitive abilities than previously thought.

Although previous neuroimaging research has shown that the brain's default mode network (DMN) supports upward eCFT, it is unclear how it is differentially recruited during internal versus external upward eCFT. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data while participants remembered negative autobiographical memories, generated either internal or external upward eCFT for the memory, and then rated the plausibility, perceived control and difficulty of eCFT generation. Both internal and external eCFT engaged midline regions of cingulate cortex, a central node of the DMN. Most activity differentiating eCFT, however, occurred outside the DMN. External eCFT engaged cuneus, angular gyrus and precuneus, whereas internal eCFT engaged posterior cingulate and precentral gyrus.

In particular, by considering potential future costs and benefits of specific behaviours, prospective cognition may lead to a more flexible use of cultural behaviours. In species with limited planning abilities, this may lead to the development of cultures that promote behaviours with future benefits, circumventing this limitation. Here, we examine these ideas from a comparative perspective, considering the relationship between human and nonhuman assessments of future possibilities and their cultural capacity to invent new solutions and improve them over time.

We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected 2-center dataset of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without later diagnosis of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). CPPopt was calculated as the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) value corresponding to the lowest pressure reactivity index (moving correlation coefficient of mean arterial and intracranial pressure). The relationship of (hourly) deltaCPP (CPP-CPPopt) and PbtO2 was investigated using natural spline regression analysis. Data after DCI diagnosis were excluded. Brain tissue hypoxia was defined as PbtO2 <20 mmHg. One hundred thirty-one patients were included with a median of 44.0 (interquartile range, 20.8-78.3) hourly CPPopt/PbtO2 datapoints.

Brain tissue hypoxia (34.6% of all measurements) was more frequent with deltaCPP <0 mmHg. These dynamics were similar in patients with or without DCI. We found a nonlinear relationship between PbtO2 and deviation of patients' CPP from CPPopt in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the pre-DCI period. CPP values below calculated CPPopt were associated with lower PbtO2. Nevertheless, the nature of PbtO2 measurements is complex, and the variability is high.

While the sensory component processes information about stimulus location and intensity, the affective component processes information regarding pain-related expectations, motivation to reduce pain, and pain unpleasantness. Unlike investigations of acute pain that are based on the introduction of real-time stimulus during brain recordings, chronic pain investigations are usually based on longitudinal and case-control studies, which are limited in their ability to infer the functional network topology of chronic pain. In the current study, we utilized the unique opportunity to target the central nervous system's pain pathways in two different hierarchical locations to establish causality between pain relief and specific connectivity changes seen within the salience and sensorimotor networks. We examined how lesions to the affective and somatic pain pathways affect resting-state network topology in cancer patients suffering from severe intractable pain. Two procedures have been employed: percutaneous cervical cordotomy (n&#8201;=&#8201;15), hypothesized to disrupt the transmission of the sensory component of pain along the spino-thalamic tract, or stereotactic cingulotomy (n&#8201;=&#8201;7), which refers to bilateral intra-cranial ablation of an area in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and is known to ameliorate the affective component of pain. Both procedures led to immediate significant alleviation of experienced pain and decreased functional connectivity within the salience network. However, only the sensory procedure (cordotomy) led to decreased connectivity within the sensorimotor network.

We previously identified mutations in FGD4, as responsible for CMT4H, an autosomal recessive demyelinating form of CMT. FGD4 encodes FRABIN, a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor, particularly for the small GTPase cdc42. Remarkably, nerves from patients with CMT4H display excessive redundant myelin figures called outfoldings that arise from focal hypermyelination, suggesting that FRABIN could play a role in the control of PNS myelination. To gain insights into the role of FGD4/FRABIN in Schwann Cell myelination, we generated a knock-out mouse model (Fgd4SC-/-), with conditional ablation of Fgd4 in Schwann cells. We show that the specific deletion of FRABIN in Schwann cells leads to aberrant myelination in vitro, in dorsal root ganglia neurons/Schwann cells cocultures as well in vivo, in distal sciatic nerves from Fgd4SC-/- mice. We observed that those myelination defects are related to an upregulation of some interactors of the NRG1 type III/ERBB2/3 signaling pathway, which is known to ensure a proper level of myelination in the peripheral nervous system. Based on a yeast two- hybrid screen, we identified SNX3 as a new partner of FRABIN, which is involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking. Interestingly, we showed that loss of FRABIN impairs endocytic trafficking which may contribute to the defective NRG1 type III/ERBB2/3 signaling and myelination. Using RNA-Seq in vitro, we have identified new potential effectors of the deregulated pathways, such as ERBIN, RAB11FIP2 and MAF, thereby providing cues to understand how FRABIN contributes to proper ERBB2 trafficking or even myelin membrane addition through cholesterol synthesis. Finally, we showed that the reestablishment of proper levels of the NRG1 type III/ERBB2/3 pathway using Niacin treatment reduces myelin outfoldings in nerves of CMT4H mice.

Thus, the emergence of new methods for an accurate and efficient calculation of such brain signals is currently of great relevance. In this paper we propose a novel method to calculate the local field potentials (LFP) and magnetic fields from mean-field models. The calculation of LFP is done via a kernel method based on unitary LFP's (the LFP generated by a single axon) that was recently introduced for spiking-networks simulations and that we adapt here for mean-field models. The calculation of the magnetic field is based on current-dipole and volume-conductor models, where the secondary currents (due to the conducting extracellular medium) are estimated using the LFP calculated via the kernel method and the effects of medium-inhomogeneities are incorporated.

DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured in cerebral tissues and cerebrovascular anomalies from 152 people with CVD participating in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI). Ten cerebral tissue types were segmented including NAWM, and vascular lesions including stroke, periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities, periventricular and deep lacunar infarcts, and perivascular spaces (PVS) using T1-weighted, proton density-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI scans. Mean DTI metrics were measured in each tissue region using a previously developed DTI processing pipeline and compared between tissues using multivariate analysis of covariance. Associations between FA in NAWM and several CVD risk factors were also examined. DTI metrics in vascular lesions differed significantly from healthy tissue. Specifically, all tissue types had significantly different MD values, while FA was also found to be different in most tissue types. FA in NAWM was inversely related to hypertension and modified Rankin scale (mRS). This study demonstrated the differences between conventional DTI metrics, FA, MD, AD, and RD, in cerebral vascular lesions and healthy tissue types. Therefore, incorporating DTI to characterize the integrity of the tissue microstructure could help to define the extent and severity of various brain vascular anomalies.

Recently, we have found that artificial sleep-like up/down-states can potentiate synaptic strength in layer V cortical neurons ex vivo. Using mouse coronal brain slices, whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from layer V cortical pyramidal neurons to record spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) and inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs). Artificial sleep-like up/down-states (as SWOs, 0.5 Hz, 10 min, current clamp mode) were induced by injecting sinusoidal currents into layer V cortical neurons. Baseline pre-SWO recordings were recorded for 5 min and post-SWO recordings for at least 25-30 min. Compared to pre-SWO sEPSCs or sIPSCs, post-SWO sEPSCs or sIPSCs in layer V cortical neurons exhibited significantly larger amplitudes and a higher frequency for 30 min. This finding suggests that both sEPSCs and sIPSCs could be potentiated in layer V cortical neurons by the low-level activity of SWOs, and sEPSCs and sIPSCs maintained a balance in layer V cortical neurons during pre- and post-SWO periods.

Pathway analysis shows that Gene Ontology terms associated with vesicular trafficking and early secretory pathway compartments are the most represented among those enriched for upregulated genes. Among these, we identified a cluster of co-regulated genes that share CREB3L1 and CREB3L2 binding elements in their promoter regions. Indeed, both CREB3L1 and CREB3L2 transcription factors are up-regulated during decidualization. Simultaneous downregulation of CREB3L1 and CREB3L2 impairs Golgi enlargement, and causes dramatic changes in decidualizing EnSC, including Golgi fragmentation, collagen accumulation in dilated Endoplasmic Reticulum cisternae, and overall decreased protein secretion.

Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone residue modifications, are highly dynamic and stage-specific during neurogenesis. Genome-wide assessment of these modifications has allowed the identification of distinct non-coding regulatory regions involved in neural cell differentiation, maturation, and plasticity. Enhancers are short DNA regulatory regions that bind transcription factors (TFs) and interact with gene promoters to increase transcriptional activity. They are of special interest in neuroscience because they are enriched in neurons and underlie the cell-type-specificity and dynamic gene expression profiles.

In periparturient dairy cows, AT goes through intensive remodeling and its dysfunction is associated with metabolic disease pathogenesis and decreased productive performance. The contributions of depot-specific cells and subtypes to the development of diseases in dairy cows remain to be studied. Our objective was to elucidate differences in cellular diversity of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) AT in dairy cows at the single-nuclei level. We collected matched SAT and VAT samples from three dairy cows and performed snRNA-seq analysis. We identified distinct cell types including four major mature adipocytes (AD) and three stem and progenitor cells (ASPC) subtypes, along with endothelial cells (EC), mesothelial cells (ME), immune cells, and pericytes and smooth muscle cells. All major cell types were present in both SAT and VAT, although a strong VAT-specificity was observed for ME, which were basically absent in SAT. One ASPC subtype was defined as adipogenic (PPARG+) while the other two had a fibro-adipogenic profile (PDGFRA+). We identified vascular and lymphatic EC subtypes, and different immune cell types and subtypes in both SAT and VAT, i.e., macrophages, monocytes, T cells, and natural killer cells. Not only did VAT show a greater proportion of immune cells, but these visceral immune cells had greater activation of pathways related to immune and inflammatory response, and complement cascade in comparison with SAT. There was a substantial contrast between depots for gene expression of complement cascade, which were greatly expressed by VAT cell subtypes compared to SAT, indicating a pro-inflammatory profile in VAT.

Recently, we reported that VAMP8, an R-SNARE found on late endosomes, increased Tau secretion and that secreted Tau was cleaved at the C-terminal. In the present study, we examined whether the increase of Tau secretion by VAMP8 affected its intra- and extracellular cleavage. Upon VAMP8 overexpression, an increase of Tau cleaved by caspase-3 in the cell lysate and medium was observed. This was correlated to an increase of active caspase-3 in the cell lysate and medium. Using a Tau mutant not cleavable by caspase-3, we demonstrated that Tau cleavage by caspase-3 was not necessary for its secretion upon VAMP8 overexpression. By adding recombinant Tau to the culture medium, we demonstrated that extracellular Tau cleavage by caspase-3 could occur because of the release of active caspase-3, which was the highest when VAMP8 was overexpressed. When cleavage of Tau by caspase-3 was prevented by using a non-cleavable mutant, secreted Tau was still cleaved at the C-terminal, the asparagine N410 contributing to it. Lastly, we demonstrated that N-terminal of Tau regulated the secretion pattern of a Tau fragment containing the microtubule-binding domain and the C-terminal of Tau upon VAMP8 overexpression.

Three patients switched to other anticonvulsants at 3 months. At long-term follow-up (8-56 months), most (84.6%) oxcarbazepine-treated patients maintained good therapeutic response at doses between 300 and 600 mg/day. Eleven (37.9%) patients experienced complete remission without medication for more than 1 month, of which six (20.7%) had long-term remission off medication for more than 12 months. Nineteen (65.5%) patients had neurovascular compression (NVC) of vestibulocochlear nerve on MRI, but its presence or absence did not predict treatment response or remission.

In this randomized clinical trial, we established changes in the net output of motoneurons innervating multiple leg muscles during stepping when transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex was paired with transcutaneous spinal (transspinal) stimulation over the thoracolumbar region during locomotor training. TMS was delivered before (TMS-transspinal) or after (transspinal-TMS) transspinal stimulation during the stance phase of the less impaired leg. Ten individuals with chronic incomplete or complete SCI received at least 20 sessions of training. Each session consisted of 240 paired stimuli delivered over 10-min blocks for 1 h during robotic assisted step training on a motorized treadmill. Body weight support, leg guidance force and treadmill speed were adjusted based on each subject's ability to step without knee buckling or toe dragging. Most transspinal evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded before and after each intervention from ankle and knee muscles during assisted stepping were modulated in a phase-dependent pattern. Transspinal-TMS and locomotor training affected motor neuron output of knee and ankle muscles with ankle TEPs to be modulated in a phase-dependent manner. TMS-transspinal and locomotor training increased motor neuron output for knee but not for ankle muscles. Our results support that targeted brain and spinal cord stimulation alters responsiveness of neurons over multiple spinal segments in people with chronic SCI.

Upon neural induction, DS cells showed reduced proliferation during the early phase followed by increased proliferation in the late phase of the neurogenic stage compared to control cells.

RNAseq analysis of late-phase DS progenitor cells revealed upregulation of S phase-promoting regulators, Notch, Wnt, Interferon pathways, and REST, and downregulation of several genes of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. NFIB and POU3F4, neurogenic genes activated by the interaction of PAX6 and the BAF complex, were downregulated in DS cells.

Novel treatments for mild AD are of utmost importance. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of hachimijiogan (HJG), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo), in the treatment of mild AD. Methods: This exploratory, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial enrolled patients with mild AD whose score on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was over 21points. All participants had been taking the same dosage of AChEI for more than 3&#160;months. The participants were randomly assigned to an HJG group taking HJG extract 7.5&#160;g/day in addition to AChEI or to a control group treated only with AChEI. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 6 months post treatment initiation on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component- Japanese version(ADAS-Jcog). The secondary outcomes were change from baseline of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Life (IADL), Apathy scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -Q score. Results: Among the 77 enrollees, the data of 69(34 HJG and 35 control)were available for analysis. The difference in the change of ADAS-Jcog from baseline to 6 months of the HJG and control groups was 1.29 (90% Confidence interval (CI), -0.74 to 3.32 p = 0.293). In the subgroup analysis, the differences in the change from baseline to 3 and 6 months for women were 3.70 (90% CI ,0.50 to 6.91, p = 0.059) and 2.90 (90% CI,0.09 to 5.71, p = 0.090), respectively.

For female talkers, EFR amplitudes were correlated with the range of f0 frequencies and the amplitude of the trough above the second formant.

White matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden is one of the key brain pathologies that have been shown to predict faster cognitive decline at a late age. One possible pathway is that PA may help maintain cognition by mitigating the detrimental effects of brain pathologies, like WMH, on cognitive change. This study aims to examine whether PA moderates the association between WMH burden and cognitive change. This population-based longitudinal study included 198 dementia-free adults aged 20-80 years. Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. Occupational physical activity (OPA) was a factor score measuring the physical demands of each job. Total physical activity (TPA) was operationalized as the average of z-scores of LTPA and OPA. Outcome variables included 5-year changes in global cognition and in four reference abilities (fluid reasoning, processing speed, memory, and vocabulary). Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the moderation effect of PA on the association between white matter hyperintensities and cognitive change, adjusting for age, sex, education, and baseline cognition. Over approximately 5 years, global cognition (p < 0.001), reasoning (p < 0.001), speed (p < 0.001), and memory (p < 0.05) scores declined, and vocabulary (p < 0.001) increased. Higher WMH burden was correlated with more decline in global cognition (Spearman's rho = -0.229, p = 0.001), reasoning (rho = -0.402, p < 0.001), and speed (rho = -0.319, p < 0.001), and less increase in vocabulary (rho = -0.316, p < 0.001). Greater TPA attenuated the association between WMH burden and changes in reasoning (&#946;TPA^*WMH = 0.029, 95% CI = 0.006-0.052, p = 0.013), speed (&#946;TPA^*WMH = 0.035, 95% CI = -0.004-0.065, p = 0.028), and vocabulary (&#946;TPA^*WMH = 0.034, 95% CI = 0.004-0.065, p = 0.029). OPA seemed to be the factor that exerted a stronger moderation on the relationship between WMH burden and cognitive change.

The protective value of vitamin D is well established and has been studied several times for the health of the bones, cartilage, growth, various dermatological diseases, and also as a chemoprotective agent against several cancers. On the scientific front, it has yet to be established that increasing serum vitamin D levels increase the incidence of BCC. We included reports that investigated this relationship in this review.

The first stage of the treatment involved surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion and occlusal decompensation, using fixed self-ligating appliance. An orthodontic software package (i.e., Dolphin 3D Surgery module) was used to perform virtual treatment objective evaluation by integrating data from cone beam computer tomography acquisition, intraoral scan, and extraoral photographs. The software allowed a comprehensive evaluation of skeletal, dento-alveolar, and soft-tissue disharmonies, qualitative and quantitative simulation of surgical procedure according to skeletal and aesthetic objectives, and, consequently, the treatment of the malocclusion. Using a specific function of the software, the surgical splint was designed according to the pre-programmed skeletal movements, and subsequently, the physical splint was generated with a three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Once a proper occlusal decompensation was reached, a Le Fort I osteotomy of the maxilla and a bilateral sagittal surgical osteotomy of the mandible were executed to restore proper skeletal relations. The whole treatment time was 8 months. The orthodontic/orthognathic combined treatment allowed to correct the skeletal and the dental imbalance, as well as the improvement of facial aesthetics. Accordingly, the treatment objectives planned in the virtual environment were achieved. Virtual planning offers new possibilities for visualizing the relationship between dental arches and surrounding bone and soft structures in a single virtual 3D model, allowing the specialists to simulate different surgical and orthodontic procedures to achieve the best possible result for the patient and providing an accurate and predictable outcome in the treatment of challenging malocclusions.", "query": "no_model"}, "36312407": {"ArticleTitle": "A Comprehensive Introduction to Magnetic Resonance Imaging Relaxometry and Contrast Agents.", "AbstractText": "The development of imaging technologies allowing noninvasive observation through solid bodies has represented a breakthrough in medical diagnosis, facilitating the comprehension of biomolecular events underlying disease and the development of more efficient therapeutic approaches.

Even though SPIONs have excellent properties regarding their biocompatibility and unique magnetic properties, they lack stability in biological fluids. To stabilize and increase the specificity of the SPIONs to target desirable cells or tissues, several surface coatings have been introduced. These surface coatings can lead to different preferences of serum protein bindings, which ultimately determine their behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, understanding the interaction of SPIONs with biological systems is important for their biocompatible design and clinical applications. In this study, using proteomic analyses, we analyzed the protein corona fingerprints on SPIONs with two different coatings, including citrate and riboflavin, that have been widely used as surface coatings and ligands for enhancing cellular uptake in breast cancer cells. Though both citrate-coated SPIONs (C-SPIONs) and riboflavin-coated SPIONs (Rf-SPIONs) showed similar sizes and zeta potentials, we found that Rf-SPIONs adsorbed more serum proteins than bare SPIONs (B-SPIONs) or C-SPIONs, which was likely due to the higher hydrophobicity of the riboflavin. The enriched proteins consisted mainly of immune-responsive and blood coagulation proteins with different fingerprint profiles. Cellular uptake studies in MCF-7 breast cancer cells comparing the activities of preformed and in situ coronas showed different uptake behaviors, suggesting the role of protein corona formation in promoting the interaction between the SPIONs and the cells.

Mismatch negativity (MMNm) was recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 25 musicians and 25 non-musicians, exposed to interleaved blocks of a complex, melody-like multi-feature paradigm and a simple, oddball control paradigm. In addition to single deviants differing in frequency (F), intensity (I), or perceived location (L), double and triple deviants were included reflecting all possible feature combinations (FI, IL, LF, FIL). Following previous work, early neural processing overlap was approximated in terms of MMNm additivity by comparing empirical MMNms obtained with double and triple deviants to modeled MMNms corresponding to summed constituent single-deviant MMNms. Significantly greater subadditivity was found in musicians compared to non-musicians, specifically for frequency-related deviants in complex, melody-like stimuli. Despite using identical sounds, expertise effects were absent from the simple oddball paradigm. This novel finding supports the integrated processing hypothesis whereby musicians recruit overlapping neural resources facilitating more integrative representations of contextually relevant stimuli such as frequency (perceived as pitch) during melody perception.

Increasing parasympathetic-vagal activation of the ANS is integral to improving the sympathovagal balance between the sympathetic- and parasympathetic nervous systems, which is often imbalanced in several chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Although research into olfactory stimulation has been observed on the ANS, it is still lacking in the exploration of odor concentration and odor-specific effects. This is particularly the case as research has not utilized specified tools, such as the olfactometer to provide precise odor delivery. Furthermore, no research has compared the results in separate sex cohorts to investigate the role of sex or the menstrual stage on the subsequent interactions. In this study, we investigated the olfactory stimulation effects of four natural odors (mushroom, lavender, jasmine, and rose) in three concentrations (low, moderate, and high) on the ANS. To observe activity from the ANS, we used an electrocardiogram (ECG) based heart rate variability (HRV) and eye-tracker technology (pupil diameter). We found for the first time in literature that there were acute dose- and duration-specific odor effects of odors on the ANS. We also found sex and menstrual cycle effects in this interaction. Furthermore, there were stark distinctions in sympathovagal activity dependent ANS activation (HRV) in comparison to the oculomotor nerve-parasympathetic/cervical sympathetic nerves dependent ANS responses (pupil diameter). Sympathovagal activity dependent HRV showed odor, sex, and menstrual-stage interactions in both divisions of the ANS while the pupil responses only indicated increased sympathetic activation. These results shed light on the use of odor-specific stimulation to modulate the ANS activity in the context of sex and the menstrual stage.

We previously reported that IL-17A acts within the brain, particularly in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), to increase expression of inflammatory mediators and, consequently, sympathetic outflow. The present study sought to determine whether IL-17A levels are elevated in a rat model of HF induced by myocardial infarction and, if so, whether increased expression of IL-17A in the brain itself contributes to neuroinflammation and cardiac dysfunction in this disease setting. Male SD rats underwent coronary artery ligation (CL) to induce HF or sham operation (SHAM). Compared with SHAM rats, HF rats exhibited significantly increased IL-17A levels in plasma, beginning within 1 week with a peak increase at 4 weeks after CL. IL-17A levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also increased in HF rats and correlated with IL-17A levels in the plasma. The mRNA expression of IL-17A and its receptor IL-17RA, but not IL-17RC, was markedly upregulated in the PVN of HF when compared with SHAM rats. Genetic knockdown of IL-17RA by bilateral PVN microinjections of an IL-17RA siRNA AAV virus attenuated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and ameliorated sympathetic activation and cardiac function in HF rats.

This paradigm allowed us to assess the degree to which aversive Pavlovian cues affect instrumental action and associated neural signaling. Psychopathic tendency scores were associated with an attenuation of aversive Pavlovian inhibition of instrumental action. Moreover, exploratory analyses revealed an anomalous positive association between aversive inhibition of action and aversive inhibition of BOLD signal in the caudate nucleus of violent offenders with psychopathic tendencies. In addition, psychopathic tendency also correlated positively with amygdala reactivity during aversive versus neutral cues in Pavlovian training.

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by severe voluntary food restriction and compulsive exercising, which combine to cause extreme body weight loss. We use activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model, to investigate the neurobiological bases of vulnerability to anorexia nervosa. This is a Mini-Review, focused on new ideas that have emerged based on recent findings from the Aoki Lab. Our findings point to the cellular and molecular underpinnings of three ABA phenomena: (1) age-dependence of ABA vulnerability; (2) individual differences in the persistence of ABA vulnerability during adolescence; (3) GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex that contributes to the suppression of the maladaptive anorexia-like behaviors. We also include new data on the contribution to ABA vulnerability by cell type-specific knockdown of a GABA receptor subunit, &#945;4, in dorsal hippocampus. Although the GABA system recurs as a key player in the gain of ABA resilience, the data predict why targeting the GABA system, singularly, may have only limited efficacy in treating anorexia nervosa. This is because boosting the GABAergic system may suppress the maladaptive behavior of over-exercising but could also suppress food consumption. We hypothesize that a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine may be the magic bullet, since a single injection of this drug to mid-adolescent female mice undergoing ABA induction enhances food consumption and reduces wheel running, thereby reducing body weight loss through plasticity at excitatory synaptic inputs to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The same treatment is not as efficacious during late adolescence but multiple dosing of ketamine can suppress ABA vulnerability partially. This caveat underscores the importance of conducting behavioral, synaptic and molecular analyses across multiple time points spanning the developmental stage of adolescence and into adulthood.

Male Long-Evans rats with freely available food and water were first accustomed to drinking 15% ethanol in their home cages using an intermittent access, two-bottle choice procedure. Then the rats were given 15 Pavlovian conditioning sessions in which a 15-s audiovisual conditioned stimulus (CS) predicted the delivery of 0.2 ml of ethanol, the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each session contained 12 CS-US trials. A control group received explicitly unpaired presentations of the CS and US. We measured Pavlovian conditioned approach to the site of US delivery during presentations of the CS, accounting for pre-CS baseline activity.

Early life stress causes cellular and molecular changes in brain regions associated with cognitive functions that are fundamental for early learning.

A significant cortisol change was observed across the experiment with non-significant interaction with attachment. The attachment and neurodevelopment association was not mediated by cortisol secretion. Preschoolers' attachment and cortisol did not associate nor interacted to predict telomere length at age seven.

In particular, the dissociation was statistically significant in the \"passive\" and \"attentive cues\" conditions. Interestingly in the \"immersive\" condition, the dissociation was not significant and, in contrast to the other conditions, trends showed better performance for egocentric than allocentric memory.

Neither treatment altered cue-elicited anticipatory activity at the reward-delivery port, indicating that dmPFC stimulation did not lead to more widespread motor suppression.

Notwithstanding the important amount of research on tobacco addiction treatments, smoking remains one of the most difficult substance use disorders to treat, probably also due to the fact that pharmacological treatment often overlooks other maintaining factors in this addiction, such as sensory impact and cue reactivity. To address this gap in both treatment protocols and scientific literature, we propose a study protocol in which we will compare the effects of combining Cytisine with Nirdosh, a herbal tobacco substitute, to Cytisine only in two groups of patients (C + N and C) who will also undergo exposure to four different virtual reality settings that will assess the importance of environmental cues.

Between March and September 2021, 53 patients with mood disorders and other mental disorders completed a survey composed of self-report questionnaires that assessed sleep quality, depressive and hypomanic symptoms, and temperament and personality traits. Positive and negative attitudes toward the pandemic experience were assessed using an ad hoc questionnaire.

Here we performed qualitative research to identify positive aspects and strengths associated with ADHD in a large convenience sample from the Dutch organization for people with ADHD, dyslexia and dyscalculia. We sent out open-ended questionnaires to the members of the organization, asking what they consider to be positive aspects of their ADHD. From the responses of individuals with ADHD (n = 206), we extracted 116 codes, which were assigned to thirteen subthemes, which in turn led to five themes. These themes were: Creativity, Being dynamic, Flexibility, Socio-affective skills, and Higher-order cognitive skills. Core symptoms of ADHD such as impulsivity and hyperactivity were also considered positive aspects of ADHD by a minority of participants. After showing our results to a group of additional individuals with ADHD (focus group) they confirmed the identified positive aspects of ADHD.

Calsequestrin (Casq) is a protein that binds large amounts of Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR terminal cisternae, near sites of Ca2+ release. There is general agreement that Casq is not only important for the SR ability to store Ca2+, but also for modulating the opening probability of the RyR Ca2+ release channels. The initial studies: About 20&#160;years ago we generated a mouse model lacking Casq1 (Casq1-null mice), the isoform predominantly expressed in adult fast twitch skeletal muscle. While the knockout was not lethal as expected, lack of Casq1 caused a striking remodeling of membranes of SR and of transverse tubules (TTs), and mitochondrial damage. Functionally, CASQ1-knockout resulted in reduced SR Ca2+ content, smaller Ca2+ transients, and severe SR depletion during repetitive stimulation. The myopathic phenotype of Casq1-null mice: After the initial studies, we discovered that Casq1-null mice were prone to sudden death when exposed to halogenated anaesthetics, heat and even strenuous exercise. These syndromes are similar to human malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and environmental-exertional heat stroke (HS). We learned that mechanisms underlying these syndromes involved excessive SR Ca2+ leak and excessive production of oxidative species: indeed, mortality and mitochondrial damage were significantly prevented by administration of antioxidants and reduction of oxidative stress. Though, how Casq1-null mice could survive without the most important SR Ca2+ binding protein was a puzzling issue that was not solved. Unravelling the mystery: The mystery was finally solved in 2020, when we discovered that in Casq1-null mice the SR undergoes adaptations that result in constitutively active store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE is a mechanism that allows skeletal fibers to use external Ca2+ when SR stores are depleted. The post-natal compensatory mechanism that allows Casq1-null mice to survive involves the assembly of new SR-TT junctions (named Ca2+ entry units) containing Stim1 and Orai1, the two proteins that mediate SOCE.", "query": "no_model"}, "36311231": {"ArticleTitle": "Editorial: Structural and mechanistic determinants of endurance performance.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "no_model"}, "36311202": {"ArticleTitle": "Does insular cortex lesion cause tinnitus in rats?", "AbstractText": "Tinnitus is defined as ringing of the ears that is experienced when there is no external sound source, and is an auditory phantom sensation.

GABA B receptors are constitutively internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane to maintain a stable number of receptors at cell surface for appropriate signaling. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dependent dephosphorylation of serine 783 (S783) in the GABA B2 subunit is a key event for downregulating GABA B receptor cell surface expression particularly under conditions associated with excitotoxicity. Here, we investigated the role of PP2A in regulating GABA B receptor cell surface expression under physiological and excitotoxic conditions. For this purpose, we developed an interfering peptide (PP2A-Pep) that inhibits the interaction of GABA B receptors with PP2A. Using cultured cortical neurons, we found that PP2A downregulates GABA B receptor cell surface expression by inhibiting recycling of the receptors and thereby promoting degradation of the receptors. Inhibition of the GABA B receptor/PP2A interaction by PP2A-Pep in cultured cortical neurons restored GABA B receptor cell surface expression after excitotoxic stress and inhibited progressing neuronal death even when added 48 h after the insult. To explore the therapeutic potential of PP2A-Pep, we further analyzed effect of PP2A-Pep in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Incubation of brain slices prepared from MCAO-treated mice with PP2A-Pep restored normal GABA B receptor expression and GABA B receptor-mediated inhibition, reduced ischemic-induced overexcitability of neurons, and prevented neuronal death in the ischemic penumbra. This data illustrates the crucial role of regulating GABA B receptor phosphorylation by PP2A for controlling neuronal inhibition and excitability.

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is a pre-clinical model of MS in which intracerebral inoculation of TMEV results in a CNS autoimmune disease that causes demyelination, neuroaxonal damage, and progressive clinical disability.

In pxf-1 mutant animals, there is a reduction in the levels of synaptic vesicles in cholinergic motor neurons but no change in the overall synapse numbers.

M-channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and plasticity. In cultured hippocampal excitatory neurons, we previously showed that chronic exposure to the M-channel blocker XE991 leads to adaptative compensations, thereby triggering at different timescales intrinsic and synaptic homeostatic plasticity. This plastic adaptation barely occurs in hippocampal inhibitory neurons. In this study, we examined whether this homeostatic plasticity induced by M-channel inhibition was bidirectional by investigating the acute and chronic effects of the M-channel opener retigabine on hippocampal neuronal excitability. Acute retigabine exposure decreased excitability in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Chronic retigabine treatment triggered in excitatory neurons homeostatic adaptation of the threshold current and spontaneous firing rate at a time scale of 4-24 h. These plastic changes were accompanied by a substantial decrease in the M-current density and by a small, though significant, proximal relocation of Kv7.3-FGF14 segment along the axon initial segment. Thus, bidirectional homeostatic changes were observed in excitatory neurons though not symmetric in kinetics and mechanisms. Contrastingly, in inhibitory neurons, the compensatory changes in intrinsic excitability barely occurred after 48 h, while no homeostatic normalization of the spontaneous firing rate was observed.

Active anodal tDCS was associated with greater improvements in working memory reaction time compared to control (p = 0.007). Reaction time improvement correlated significantly with the degree of connectivity change between the right DLPFC and the left anterior insula (p = 0.02).

Cajal's iconic images of pyramidal neurons and glial cells surprisingly suggest a non-realist approach to picturing the brain and the mind that opens a new methodological link between humanities and neurosciences. In it, aesthetic works offer a perspective on mimetic practices in neurosciences, providing insight into representational strategies that make otherwise invisible psychic phenomena observable. This approach draws needed attention to the role of metaphor in neuroscientific research. It also reimagines how interdisciplinary scholarship might engage with works of art. While it is a common practice to read humanities objects featuring the brain and/or the mind in terms of their neuroscientific content, films like The Headless Woman (La mujer sin cabeza, dir. Martel, 2008), explored here, show that doing so can easily inhibit interpretations with greater explanatory bearing.

To address this gap, a recent study proposed a biologically plausible model based on a spiking recurrent neural network supplemented with read-out neurons. After learning, the recurrent network develops precise switching dynamics by successively activating and deactivating small groups of neurons. The read-out neurons are trained to respond to particular groups and can thereby reproduce the learned sequence.

In this study, we further that aim by providing a replication of a seminal cortical column model. This model consists of noisy Hodgkin-Huxley neurons connected by dynamic synapses, whose connectivity scheme is based on empirical findings from intracellular recordings. Our analysis confirms the key original finding that the specific, data-based connectivity structure enhances the computational performance compared to a variety of alternatively structured control circuits. For this comparison, we use tasks based on spike patterns and rates that require the systems not only to have simple classification capabilities, but also to retain information over time and to be able to compute nonlinear functions. Going beyond the scope of the original study, we demonstrate that this finding is independent of the complexity of the neuron model, which further strengthens the argument that it is the connectivity which is crucial. Finally, a detailed analysis of the memory capabilities of the circuits reveals a stereotypical memory profile common across all circuit variants.

A sequence of co-design workshops with stroke survivors, family carers, and with health and social care professionals, ran in parallel with an analysis of behavioural factors. This determined key actions which could improve mouthcare for this community and identified opportunities to integrate recognized behaviour-change techniques into the intervention. In this way, behaviour change theory, evidence&#160;from qualitative research, and experience-based co-design were effectively combined. The intervention proposed is predominantly a patient-facing resource, intended to support stroke survivors and their carers with mouth care, as they transition from hospital care to living at home.

Increasing demand for provision of care to stroke survivors creates challenges for health care planners. A key concern is the optimal alignment of health care resources between provision of acute care, rehabilitation, and among different segments of rehabilitation, including inpatient rehabilitation, early supported discharge (ESD), and outpatient rehabilitation (OPR). We propose a novel application of discrete event simulation (DES) combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to identify the optimal configuration of rehabilitation that maximizes patient benefits subject to finite health care resources. Design. Our stroke rehabilitation optimal model (sROM) combines DES and GA to identify an optimal solution that minimizes wait time for each segment of rehabilitation by changing care capacity across different segments. sROM is initiated by generating parameters for DES. GA is used to evaluate wait time from DES. If wait time meets specified stopping criteria, the search process stops at a point at which optimal capacity is reached. If not, capacity estimates are updated, and an additional iteration of the DES is run. To parameterize the model, we standardized real-world data from medical records by fitting them into probability distributions. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood of stroke survivors flowing across rehabilitation segments. Results. We predict that rehabilitation planners in Alberta, Canada, have the potential to improve services by increasing capacity from 75 to 113 patients per day for ESD and from 101 to 143 patients per day for OPR. Compared with the status quo, optimal capacity would provide ESD to 138 (s = 29.5) more survivors and OPR to 262 (s = 45.5) more annually while having an estimated net annual cost savings of $25.45&#8201;(s = 15.02) million. Conclusions. The combination of DES and GA can be used to estimate optimal service capacity. We created a hybrid model combining a genetic algorithm and discrete event simulation to search for the optimal configuration of health care service capacity that maximizes patient outcomes subject to finite health system resources.We applied a probability distribution fitting process to standardize real-world data to probability distributions. The process consists of choosing the distribution type and estimating the parameters of that distribution that best reflects the data. Standardizing real-word data to a best-fitted distribution can increase model generalizability.In an illustrative study of stroke rehabilitation care, resource allocation to stroke rehabilitation services under an optimal configuration allows provision of care to more stroke survivors who need services while reducing wait time.Resources needed to expand rehabilitation services could be reallocated from the savings due to reduced wait time in acute care units. In general, the predicted optimal configuration of stroke rehabilitation services is associated with a net cost savings to the health care system.", "query": "no_model"}, "36310538": {"ArticleTitle": "Neurofilament light chain in drug development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a critical appraisal.", "AbstractText": "Interest in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) biomarkers has grown exponentially over the course of the last 25 years, with great hope that they might serve as tools to facilitate the development of meaningful therapies for this otherwise inexorably progressive and invariably fatal disease.

We conclude that: (1) it may serve as a susceptibility/risk biomarker in populations at elevated risk for ALS; (2) it has value as a prognostic biomarker when measured early in the course of established disease, empowering stratification or dynamic randomization to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio of promising therapeutics; and (3) there is sufficient evidence to support the use of a reduction in NfL in response to an experimental therapeutic as a pharmacodynamic biomarker that may aid in phase 2 trial go/no-go decisions.

Because upregulation of autophagy is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diverse disorders, it is vital that we understand how this pathway functions in different tissues and this is best done by in vivo analysis. Similarly, to understand the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease, it is important to study this process in the whole animal to investigate how tissue-specific changes in flux and cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous effects alter disease progression. To this end, we have developed an inducible expression system to up- or downregulate autophagy in vivo, in zebrafish.

Using this inducible expression system, we have tested which transgenes robustly up- or downregulate autophagy and have validated these tools using Lc3-II blots and puncta analysis and disease rescue in a zebrafish model of neurodegeneration. These tools allow the temporal control of autophagy via the administration of tamoxifen and spatial control via tissue or cell-specific ERT2-Gal4 driver lines and will enable the investigation of how cell- or tissue-specific changes in autophagic flux affect processes such as aging, inflammation and neurodegeneration in vivo.Abbreviations: ANOVA: analysis of variance; Atg: autophagy related; Bcl2l11/Bim: BCL2 like 11; d.p.f.: days post-fertilization; Cryaa: crystallin, alpha a: DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; Elavl3: ELAV like neuron-specific RNA binding protein 3; ER: estrogen receptor; ERT2: modified ligand-binding domain of human ESR1/estrogen receptor &#945;; Gal4: galactose-responsive transcription factor 4; GFP: green fluorescent protein; h.p.f.: hours post-fertilization; HSP: heat-shock protein; Map1lc3/Lc3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; RFP: red fluorescent protein; SD: standard deviation; SEM: standard error of the mean; UAS: upstream activating sequence; Ubb: ubiquitin b.", "query": "no_model"}, "36310339": {"ArticleTitle": "The prognostic implication of latitude in uveal melanoma: a nationwide observational cohort study of all patients born in Sweden between 1947 and 1989.", "AbstractText": "The incidence of uveal melanoma increases with latitude.

The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) plays a critical role in modulation of nociception and analgesia, but the exact intracellular pathways associated with opioid responses in this region are not fully understood. We previously showed that knockout of the signal transduction modulator RGSz1 (RGSZ1KO) enhanced analgesic responses to opioids, while it decreased the rewarding efficacy of morphine. Here, we applied viral mediated gene transfer and delivered AAV-Cre viruses to the vlPAG of RGSz1fl\\fl mice to demonstrate that downregulation of RGSz1 in this region decreases sensitivity to morphine in the place preference paradigm, under pain-free as well as neuropathic pain states. We also utilized retrograde viral vectors along with flipase-dependent Cre vectors to conditionally downregulate RGSz1 in vlPAG projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and show that downregulation of RGSz1 prevents the development of place conditioning to low morphine doses. Consistent with the role for RGSz1 as a negative modulator of MOPR activity, RGSz1KO enhances opioid-induced cAMP inhibition in PAG membranes. Furthermore, using a new generation of BRET sensors, we demonstrate that RGSz1 modulates Galphaz but not other Gai subunits, and selectively impedes MOPR-mediated Galphaz signaling events invoked by morphine and other opioids. Our work highlights a regional and circuit-specific role of the G protein signaling modulator RGSz1 in morphine reward, providing insights on midbrain intracellular pathways that control addiction-related behaviors.

This study is a single-center case-control study performed at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. Women with clinically diagnosed lipedema underwent regional BC assessment by DXA. The control group without clinical lipedema was matched for age and body mass index (BMI) at a ratio of 1:2 and underwent similar examination. Regional FM (legs, arms, legs and arms, trunk, android and gynoid FM) was measured in (kg) and divided by FM index (FMI) (kg/m2) and total FM (kg). The trunk/legs and android/gynoid ratios were calculated. For all indices of FM distribution showing a significant difference between cases and controls, we defined the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calculating the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index. Types and stages of lipedema were compared in terms of FM indices. Correlation analyses between all FM distribution indices and lipedema stages were performed. We included 222 women (74 with lipedema and 148 controls). Overall, the mean age was 41 years (standard deviation [SD] 11), and mean BMI was 30.9 kg/m2 (SD 7.6).

The role of the CA2 in the development of social memory for recently encountered same-age conspecifics, that is, peers, has not been previously reported. Here, we used a direct social interaction test to characterize the emergence of novelty preference for peers during development and found that at the end of the second postnatal week, pups begin to significantly prefer novel over familiar peers. Using chemogenetic inhibition at this time, we showed that CA2 activity is necessary for the emergence of novelty preference and for the ability to distinguish never encountered from&#160;recently encountered peers. In adulthood, the CA2 region is known to integrate a large number of inputs from various sources, many of which participate in social recognition memory, but previous studies have not determined whether these afferents are present at adult levels by the end of the second postnatal week.

Using retroviral labeling of postnatally generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus, we found that mossy fiber projections to the CA2 mature faster during development than those generated in adulthood.

We used eye tracking to facilitate an interactive social simulation wherein onscreen faces would establish eye-contact when the participant looked at them. In Experiment One, receipt of eye-contact was unpredictable; in Experiment Two, receipt of eye-contact was predictable. Neural response to eye-contact was measured via the N170 and P300 event-related potentials (ERPs). Experiment One included 23 ASD and 46 typically developing (TD) adult participants. Experiment Two included 25 ASD and 43 TD adult participants. When receipt of eye-contact was unpredictable, individuals with ASD showed increased N170 and increased, but non-specific, P300 responses. The magnitude of the N170 responses correlated with measures of sensory and anxiety symptomology, such that increased response to eye-contact was associated with increased symptomology. However, when receipt of eye-contact was predictable, individuals with ASD, relative to controls, exhibited slower N170s and no differences in the amplitude of N170 or P300. Our ASD sample was composed of adults with IQ&#8201;>&#8201;70 and included only four autistic women. Thus, further research is needed to evaluate how these results generalize across the spectrum of age, sex, and cognitive ability. Additionally, as analyses were exploratory, some findings failed to survive false-discovery rate adjustment. Neural response to eye-contact in ASD ranged from attenuated to hypersensitive depending on the predictability of the social context. These findings suggest that the vulnerabilities in eye-contact during social interactions in ASD may arise from differences in anticipation and expectation of eye-contact in addition to the perception of gaze alone.", "query": "no_model"}, "36309759": {"ArticleTitle": "Treatment of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy with an endothelin antagonist: ENDOTHELION (ENDOTHELin antagonist receptor in Ischemic Optic Neuropathy)-a multicentre randomised controlled trial protocol.", "AbstractText": "Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAAION) is a major cause of blindness in individuals over 50 years of age, with no available effective treatment. The oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, increases retinal optic nerve head blood flow in healthy humans and glaucoma patients. The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of bosentan administered at the acute stage in improving outcomes in NAAION patients. ENDOTHELION (ENDOTHELin antagonist receptor in Ischemic Optic Neuropathy) is a phase III, interventional, prospective, multicentre, placebo-controlled randomised double-blind clinical trial. The primary outcome is change in the visual field mean deviation (MD) at 3 months (Humphrey 30-2 SITA standard programme). Secondary outcomes include MD and visual acuity changes up to 24 months, changes in peripapillary retinal nerve fibre and macular ganglion cell layer thickness in the affected eye, as measured by optical coherence tomography, rate of NAAION bilateralisation at 2 years, and quality-of-life. Patients over 50 years of age presenting with typical NAAION of recent onset (less than 21 days) are randomly assigned to either 125 mg oral bosentan or placebo, twice a day, during 8 weeks. Besides visits during the treatment phase, patients attend follow-up visits at 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The inclusion of patients began in August 2015 at five French University hospital ophthalmology departments and two specialised ophthalmology centres. It is planned to include 86 patients in this trial. To date we have included 72 patients and 49 have completed the full follow-up process. An endothelin receptor antagonist is a potential approach to improving the anatomical and functional prognosis of patients with NAAION. This multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial is an opportunity to assess (1) the effect of bosentan on the structure and function of the optic nerve in NAAION, at 3 months, (2) the effect of bosentan on the bilateralisation rate at 24 months and (3) the tolerance profile of bosentan in this population.

Significant weight loss was not associated with changes in circulating AMH levels, neither in women with, nor without PCOS and severe obesity.

Epileptiform activity initiated by this 'paced-recruitment' procedure propagates throughout PPC and into other areas involved in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) at an exceedingly low velocity (< 1&#160;mm/sec) as reported for focal seizures in human cortex. Proconvulsants increased the probability of recruiting electrographic seizures relative to disinhibiting agents that typically recruited interictal discharges. Through methods including realtime recording of current source-density (CSD) with vertical 22-site silicon-based electrodes, and membrane potential with transmembrane microelectrode pairs, insights were gained into mechanisms for epileptogenesis from PC. These findings also may apply to seizure initiation from epileptogenic zones in other areas that project to PPC in addition to APC. Findings from surgical studies indicating that PC plays a critical role in mTLE suggest that the results may be relevant to finding new approaches for blocking seizures from this common, virulent form of epilepsy. Immediate implications for treatment include the optimal placement and patterning of deep brain stimulation to increase its effectiveness for blocking seizures from mTLE while reducing the risk to vasculature from direct stimulation of PC.", "query": "no_model"}, "36308992": {"ArticleTitle": "The association of glutamate level in pregenual anterior cingulate, anhedonia, and emotion-behavior decoupling in patients with major depressive disorder.", "AbstractText": "Impairments of translating emotional salience into effortful behavior are core features of anhedonia in cohorts with major depressive disorder. Glutamate metabolism is considered to be involved in this process, but the empirical study is relatively few. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the correlations between glutamate level in pregenual anterior cingulate, anhedonia, and emotion-behavior decoupling in patients with major depressive disorder. Fifteen individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder and ten healthy individuals were recruited. All participants were asked to complete self-report instruments for anhedonia and the computerized anticipatory and consummatory pleasure task, and the in vivo glutamate levels were measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thus, a potential lower glutamate levels in pregenual anterior cingulate in individuals with major depressive disorder were founded to be positively correlated with the ability of pleasure experiencing. The mechanism of glutamate in pregenual anterior cingulate in anhedonia in patients with major depressive disorder may be reflected in the early pleasurable experience stage, rather than in the transformation of emotional experience to motivation or reward-seeking behavior, which may be different from that in schizophrenia.", "query": "no_model"}, "36308971": {"ArticleTitle": "Evidence of increased sequestration of pro-resolving lipid mediators within brain esterified lipid pools of multiple sclerosis patients.", "AbstractText": "Unresolved inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with progressive demyelination and symptom worsening.

It is not known whether disturbances in the turnover of free lipid mediators from esterified pools exist in postmortem brain of MS patients. We hypothesized that resolution pathways are impaired in MS patients because of disturbances in the turnover of free pro-resolving lipid mediators from esterified lipids. The objective was to characterize free and esterified oxylipins in postmortem prefrontal cortex of MS and unaffected control participants. Oxylipins in free, neutral lipid and phospholipid pools were extracted from prefrontal cortex of 10 MS participants and 5 unaffected controls, separated by solid phase extraction columns, and quantified by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences between the control and MS groups were determined by an unpaired t-test with Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction (10%) applied to oxylipins within each lipid pool. The concentration of 7 esterified pro-resolving fatty acid epoxides within neutral lipids were significantly higher by 126%-285% in postmortem prefrontal cortex of MS compared to control participants. The concentration of esterified linoleic acid-derived 9(10)-epoxy-octadecenoic acid, a pro-inflammatory epoxide, was higher by 206% in MS compared to controls. No significant changes were observed in free or phospholipid-bound oxylipins.

The predominant interaction is accentuated antagonism (AA), where the bradycardia produced by vagal stimulation (VNS) is amplified when heart rate has been increased by sympathetic stimulation (SNS) or beta-adrenergic agonists. The acetylcholine-activated potassium current (IK,Ach), is the primary driver of vagal bradycardia. To examine the participation of IK,Ach in AA, a series of experiments was performed on isolated, double innervated, guinea-pig atrial preparations. Vagal bradycardia was elicited by 10-s trains (1, 2, 5 and 7.5&#160;Hz) or single bursts of VNS (3 stimuli at 50&#160;Hz) before and during acceleration of HR by either SNS (1-3&#160;Hz) or isoprenaline (ISO), in both absence and presence of tertiapin-Q (TQ-IK,Ach blocker). When expressed as an absolute change in HR (beats/min), bradycardia produced by VNS trains was amplified (AA) at all frequencies of VNS in ISO, and at 5 and 7.5&#160;Hz during SNS. Bradycardia in response to 1 and 2&#160;Hz VNS was reduced during SNS. In TQ, only the bradycardia produced by 5 and 7.5&#160;Hz VNS in ISO was amplified. The bradycardia produced by a single burst of VNS was amplified in both ISO and SNS. After TQ the bradycardia in response to a VNS burst was unchanged in ISO, while it was reduced during SNS.

Diminished responses to low frequencies of VNS (1 and 2&#160;Hz) persisted, and were also seen during IK,Ach block by TQ. We applied the same adjustment to data from 20 published studies.

Correlations and subgroup analyses within the FRDA cohort were undertaken based on disease duration, ataxia severity, and onset age. Individuals with FRDA, relative to control subjects, had significantly reduced CSA at all examined levels, with large effect sizes (d&#160;>&#8201;2.1) and significant correlations with disease severity (r&#160;<&#8201;-0.4).

Subgroup analyses showed that CSA and eccentricity are abnormal at all disease stages. However, although CSA appears to decrease progressively, eccentricity remains stable over time. Previous research has shown that increased eccentricity reflects dorsal column (DC) damage, while decreased CSA reflects either DC or corticospinal tract (CST) damage, or both. Hence our data support the hypothesis that damage to the DC and damage to CST follow distinct courses in FRDA: developmental abnormalities likely define the DC, while CST alterations may be both developmental and degenerative.

Seventeen patients with focal precuneal infiltration were selected (mean age 38.1 &#177; 11.2 years) and matched to 17 healthy participants (mean age 40.5 &#177; 10.4 years) for rsFC analyses. All patients underwent awake cognitive mapping, allowing total resection (n = 3) or subtotal resection (n = 14), with a mean extent of resection of 90.6% &#177; 7.3%. Using MVPA (cluster threshold: p-false discovery rate corrected < 0.05, voxel threshold: p-uncorrected < 0.001), remote hotspots with significant rsFC changes were identified, including both insulas, the anterior cingulate cortex, superior sensorimotor cortices, and both frontal eye fields. Further seed-network analyses captured 2 patterns of between-network redistribution especially involving hyperconnectivity between the salience, visual, and dorsal attentional networks. Finally, the global efficiency of the salience-visual-dorsal attentional networks was strongly and positively correlated to 3-month postsurgical scores (n = 15) for phonological fluency (r15 = 0.74, p = 0.0027); TMT-A (r15 = 0.65, p = 0.012); TMT-B (r15 = 0.70, p = 0.005); and TMT-B-A (r15 = 0.62, p = 0.018).

The authors aimed to elucidate patient and surgical factors associated with new-onset sustained pain after CSM surgery. The authors reviewed data from the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) CSM module. The presence of neck pain was defined using the neck pain numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients with no neck pain at baseline (neck NRS score &#8804; 1) were then stratified based on the presence of new postoperative pain development (neck NRS score &#8805; 2) at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Of 1141 patients in the CSM QOD, 224 (19.6%) reported no neck pain at baseline. Among 170 patients with no baseline neck pain and available 12-month follow-up, 46 (27.1%) reported new postoperative pain. Among 184 patients with no baseline neck pain and available 24-month follow-up, 53 (28.8%) reported new postoperative pain. The mean differences in neck NRS scores were 4.3 for those with new postoperative pain compared with those without at 12 months (4.4 &#177; 2.2 vs 0.1 &#177; 0.3, p < 0.001) and 3.9 at 24 months (4.1 &#177; 2.4 vs 0.2 &#177; 0.4, p < 0.001). The majority of patients reporting new-onset neck pain reported being satisfied with surgery, but their satisfaction was significantly lower compared with patients without pain at the 12-month (66.7% vs 94.3%, p < 0.001) and 24-month (65.4% vs 90.8%, p < 0.001) follow-ups. The baseline Neck Disability Index (NDI) was an independent predictor of new postoperative neck pain at both the 12-month and 24-month time points (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.002; and aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.026, respectively). The total number of levels treated was associated with new-onset neck pain at 12 months (aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.64; p = 0.005), and duration of symptoms more than 3 months was a predictor of 24-month neck pain (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.01-10.22; p = 0.048). Increased NDI at baseline, number of levels treated surgically, and duration of symptoms longer than 3 months preoperatively correlate positively with the risk of new-onset neck pain following CSM surgery.

Consumption of probiotics by the pro-off group caused remarkable high expression of the 5HT2AC receptor gene. In the pro-off group, consumption of probiotics led to a significant decrease in 5HT1 receptor expression. Expression of GABRA2 was increased in probiotics-treated groups, thus the pro-off and the pro-dam group had a significant difference from the control group. Feeding offspring with probiotics by significantly increased progesterone concentrations compared to the control group, and maternal consumption of probiotics during pregnancy and lactation had no reducing effect on progesterone concentrations. This is due to electric shock stress. The consumption of probiotics by mice during infancy was shown to compensate for the decrease in progesterone concentration in them.

Data about electroclinical and demographic features, intellectual functioning, migraine with or without aura, family history of epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes in relatives were collected in each patient. The impact of age at epilepsy onset (AEO) on EEM clinical features was investigated, along with the distinctive clinical characteristics of patients showing sporadic myoclonia over body regions other than eyelids (body-MYO). Kernel density estimation revealed a trimodal distribution of AEO and Fisher-Jenks optimization disclosed three EEM subgroups: early-onset (EO-EEM), intermediate-onset (IO-EEM) and late-onset subgroup (LO-EEM). EO-EEM was associated with the highest rate of intellectual disability, antiseizure medication refractoriness and psychiatric comorbidities and with the lowest rate of family history of epilepsy.

PD brains show accumulation of &#945;-synuclein in Lewy bodies and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. However, the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial pathology in sporadic PD are poorly understood. PINK1 is a key for mitophagy activation and recycling of unfit mitochondria. The activation of mitophagy depends on the accumulation of uncleaved PINK1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane and activation of a cascade of protein ubiquitination at the surface of the organelle. We have now found that SIAH3, a member of the SIAH proteins but lacking ubiquitin-ligase activity, is increased in PD brains and cerebrospinal fluid and in neurons treated with &#945;-synuclein preformed fibrils (&#945;-SynPFF). We also observed that SIAH3 is aggregated together with PINK1 in the mitochondria of PD brains. SIAH3 directly interacts with PINK1, leading to their intra-mitochondrial aggregation in cells and neurons and triggering a cascade of toxicity with PINK1 inactivation along with mitochondrial depolarization and neuronal death. We also found that SIAH1 interacts with PINK1 and promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PINK1. Similar to the dimerization of SIAH1/SIAH2, SIAH3 interacts with SIAH1, promoting its translocation to mitochondria and preventing its ubiquitin-ligase activity toward PINK1. Our results support the notion that the increase in SIAH3 and intra-mitochondrial aggregation of SIAH3-PINK1 may mediate &#945;-synuclein pathology by promoting proteotoxicity and preventing the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria.

To assess the importance of the estrous cycle information for the analysis of sex differences in neuroscience research, we re-analyzed our previously published data with or without the estrous cycle information, giving a side-by-side comparison of the analyses of behavior, brain structure, gene expression, and 3D genome organization in female and male mice. We also examined and compared the variance of female and male groups across all neurobehavioral measures. We show that accounting for the estrous cycle significantly increases the resolution of the neuroscience studies and allows for: (a) identification of masked sex differences; (b) mechanistic insight(s) into the identified sex differences, across different neurobehavioral outcomes, from behavior to molecular phenotypes. We confirm previous findings that female data from either mixed- or staged-female groups are, on average, not more variable than that of males. However, we show that female variability is not, at all, predictive of whether the estrous cycle plays an important role in regulating the outcome of interest. We argue that \"bringing back\" the estrous cycle variable to the main stage is important in order to enhance the resolution and quality of the data, to advance the health of women and other menstruators, and to make research more gender-inclusive.

From rodent behavior to gene regulation, accounting for the estrous cycle increases the resolution of the neuroscience data, allowing identification and mechanistic insight(s) into sex differences. Female variability does not equal (and is not predictive of) the estrous cycle effect and should not be used as a proxy for the effects of ovarian hormones on the outcome of interest.

B cells (&#8773; 2.6 million) from 12 different samples collected from nine MuSK MG patients were screened for MuSK specificity. We successfully isolated two MuSK-specific IgG4 subclass-expressing plasmablasts from two of these patients, who were experiencing a relapse after a BCDT-induced remission. Human recombinant MuSK mAbs were then generated to validate binding specificity and characterize their molecular properties.

Subtle differences in planning and control can contribute to impulsive behaviors, which are common in Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and difficult to be assessed and trained. We adapted a Go/No-Go task and employed a portable, low-cost kinematic sensor to explore the different strategies used by children with ADHD or typical development to provide a prepotent response (dominant condition) or inhibit the prepotent and select an alternative one (non-dominant condition). Although no group difference emerged on accuracy levels, the kinematic analysis of correct responses revealed that, unlike neurotypical children, those with ADHD did not show increased motor planning in non-dominant compared to dominant trials. Future studies should investigate whether motor control could help children with ADHD compensate for planning difficulties. This strategy might make inhibition harder in naturalistic situations that involve complex actions. Combining cognitive and kinematic measures is a potential innovative method for assessment and intervention of subtle differences in executive processes such as inhibition, going deeper than is possible based on accuracy outcomes alone.", "query": "no_model"}, "36307435": {"ArticleTitle": "The N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase METTL16 enables erythropoiesis through safeguarding genome integrity.", "AbstractText": "During erythroid differentiation, the maintenance of genome integrity is key for the success of multiple rounds of cell division.

METTL16-deficient erythroblasts exhibit defective differentiation capacity, DNA damage and activation of the apoptotic program. Mechanistically, METTL16 controls m6A deposition at the structured motifs in DNA-repair-related transcripts including Brca2 and Fancm mRNAs, thereby upregulating their expression. Furthermore, a pairwise CRISPRi screen revealed that the MTR4-nuclear RNA exosome complex is involved in the regulation of METTL16 substrate mRNAs in erythroblasts.

Therefore, we investigated the electrophysiology of cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits in Nrxn1&#945;-/- rats and wildtype littermates focusing on a set of translational readouts, including spontaneous oscillatory activity, auditory-evoked oscillations and potentials, as well as mismatch negativity-like (MMN) responses and responses to social stimuli. On the behavioral level Nrxn1&#945;-/- rats showed locomotor hyperactivity. In vivo freely moving electrophysiology revealed pronounced increases of spontaneous oscillatory power within the gamma band in all studied brain areas and elevation of gamma coherence in cortico-striatal and thalamocortical circuits of Nrxn1&#945;-/- rats. In contrast, auditory-evoked oscillations driven by chirp-modulated tones showed reduced power in cortical areas confined to slower oscillations. Finally, Nrxn1&#945;-/- rats exhibited altered auditory evoked-potentials and profound deficits in MMN-like responses, explained by reduced prediction error. Despite deficits for auditory stimuli, responses to social stimuli appeared intact. A central hypothesis for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders is that a disbalance of excitation-to-inhibition is underlying oscillatory and sensory deficits. In a first attempt to explore the impact of inhibitory circuit modulation, we assessed the effects of enhancing tonic inhibition via &#948;-containing GABAA receptors (using Gaboxadol) on endophenotypes possibly associated with network hyperexcitability.

Lithium salts are commonly prescribed as a mood stabilizer for individuals with bipolar disorder. Lithium is clinically effective in approximately half of treated individuals, and their genetic backgrounds are known to influence treatment outcomes. While the mechanism of lithium's therapeutic action is unclear, it stimulates adult neural progenitor cell proliferation, similar to some antidepressant drugs. To identify common genetic variants that modulate lithium-induced proliferation, we conducted an EdU incorporation assay in a library of 80 genotyped human neural progenitor cells treated with lithium. These data were used to perform a genome-wide association study to identify common genetic variants that influence lithium-induced neural progenitor cell proliferation. We manipulated the expression of a putatively causal gene using CRISPRi/a (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference/activation) constructs to experimentally verify lithium-induced proliferation effects. We identified a locus on chr3p21.1 associated with lithium-induced proliferation. This locus is also associated with bipolar disorder risk, schizophrenia risk, and interindividual differences in intelligence. We identified a single gene, GNL3, whose expression temporally increased in an allele-specific fashion following lithium treatment. Experimentally increasing the expression of GNL3 led to increased proliferation under baseline conditions, while experimentally decreasing GNL3 expression suppressed lithium-induced proliferation. Our experiments reveal that common genetic variation modulates lithium-induced neural progenitor proliferation and that GNL3 expression is necessary for the full proliferation-stimulating effects of lithium.

We used topical capsaicin to induce cutaneous hypersensitivity in the right arm of 20 healthy volunteers, and recorded sympathetic skin responses (SSR) and numerical perceptive ratings (NRS) to stimulation of the sensitized region and its homologous contralateral site, using brush (A&#946;), pinprick (A&#948;) and laser (C-Warmth) stimuli.

Autism progression has been linked to dysregulation of IGF-1/GLP-1 signalling. 4-hydroxyisoleucine (HI), a pharmacologically active amino acid produced from Trigonella foenum graecum, works as an insulin mimic and has neuroprotective properties.

Propionic acid (PPA) injections to rats by intracerebroventricular (ICV) route for the first 11&#160;days of the experiment resulted in autism-like neurobehavioral, neurochemical, gross morphological, and histopathological abnormalities.

The purpose of this study was to characterize RGS2 expression in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and test its role in metabolic homeostasis. We used a combination of RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatic analyses to characterize the pattern of Rgs2 expression in the PVN. We then created mice lacking Rgs2 either prenatally or postnatally in the PVN and evaluated their metabolic consequences. RNAscope ISH analysis revealed a broad but regionally enriched Rgs2 mRNA expression throughout the mouse brain, with the highest expression being observed in the PVN along with several other brain regions, such as the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus and the dorsal raphe nucleus. Within the PVN, we found that Rgs2 is specifically enriched in CRH+&#160;endocrine neurons and is further increased by calorie restriction. Functionally, although Sim1-Cre-mediated prenatal deletion of Rgs2 in PVN neurons had no major effects on metabolic homeostasis, AAV-mediated adult deletion of Rgs2 in the PVN led to significantly increased food intake, body weight (both fat and fat-free masses), body length, and blood glucose levels in both male and female mice. Strikingly, we found that prolonged postnatal loss of Rgs2 leads to neuronal cell death in the PVN, while rapid body weight gain in the early phase of viral-mediated PVN Rgs2 deletion is independent of PVN neuronal loss.

The aim of this study is to compare two currently adopted surgical strategies, compartmental surgery (CTS) and wide local excision (WLE), with loco-regional control as the main oncological endpoint. An observational retrospective multicentric study was carried out enrolling a cohort of patients affected by oral tongue or floor of the mouth squamous cell carcinoma and surgically treated in 4 international tertiary referral centers. Survival analysis was performed by propensity-score matching approach and multivariable Cox regression analysis. A cohort of 933 patients was enrolled. CTS was applied in 113 patients (12.1%) and WLE in 820 (87.9%). Analyzing a propensity-score matched cohort (98 CTS vs. 172 WLE) and applying a survival multivariable modeling strategy on the whole cohort, both confirmed that CTS and WLE are comparable and oncologically safe. Parameters such as number of positive lymph nodes, depth of invasion, and lymphovascular invasion still represent the key prognosticators. The main goals for surgical resection of oral cancer remain its three-dimensional circumferential clearance with adequate margins and en-bloc removal of the tumor-lymph node tract, independently of the technique adopted (CTS or WLE).

While, under NoGo condition, insomnia participants also have longer latency, but higher amplitude of N2 or P3. another major finding was that different correlation was found between gender,anxiety-depression,duration, education,BMI,sleep characteristics and N2 or P3. Our study has revealed that sleep loss may influence the response inhibition ability in insomnia, not only on behavior level, but also on the electrophysiological level. Abnormal changes in inhibition process or inhibition supervision can be represented as N2/P3 components under Go/No-go condition.

Here, we report the induction of sustained axon regeneration, neural activities in the superior colliculus (SC), and visual function recovery after optic nerve crush (ONC) by M1, a small molecule that promotes mitochondrial fusion and transport. We demonstrated that M1 enhanced mitochondrial dynamics in cultured neurons and accelerated in&#160;vivo axon regeneration in the PNS. Ex vivo time-lapse imaging and kymograph analysis showed that M1 greatly increased mitochondrial length, axonal mitochondrial motility, and transport velocity in peripheral axons of the sciatic nerves. Following ONC, M1 increased the number of axons regenerating through the optic chiasm into multiple subcortical areas and promoted the recovery of local field potentials in the SC after optogenetic stimulation of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in complete recovery of the pupillary light reflex, and restoration of the response to looming visual stimuli was detected. M1 increased the gene expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins and major axonal transport machinery in both the PNS and CNS neurons without inducing inflammatory responses.

The importance of this problem is underscored by the observation that behavioral passivity in stress coping is associated with elevations in glucocorticoid hormones, and each may carry risks for susceptibility to a host of stress-related diseases. Past work implicates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the top-down regulation of stress-related behaviors; however, it is unknown whether such changes have the capacity to buffer against the longer-lasting biological consequences associated with aversive experiences. Using the shock probe defensive burying test in rats to naturalistically measure behavioral and endocrine features of coping, we observed that the active behavioral component of stress coping is associated with increases in activity along a circuit involving the caudal mPFC and midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG). Optogenetic manipulations of the caudal mPFC-to-dorsolateral PAG pathway bidirectionally modulated active (escape and defensive burying) behaviors, distinct from a rostral mPFC-ventrolateral PAG circuit that instead limited passive (immobility) behavior. Strikingly, under conditions that biased rats toward a passive coping response set, including exaggerated stress hormonal output and increased immobility, excitation of the caudal mPFC-dorsolateral PAG projection significantly attenuated each of these features.

Considering the importance of force feedback during limb control, here we hypothesised that independent cues delivered by means of background loads could support simultaneous adaptation to various velocity-dependent force fields, for identical kinematic plan and movement goal. We demonstrate in a series of experiments that indeed healthy adults can adapt to opposite force fields, independently of the direction of the background force cue. However, when the cue and force field were in the same direction but differed by heir magnitude, the formation of different motor representations was still observed but the associated mechanism was subject to increased interference.

In this study, we examine more detailed connectomes with edge weighting and orientation properties, in which reciprocal neuronal connections are also considered. Diffusion processes are a further necessary condition for generating dynamic bioelectric patterns in connectomes. Based on our high-precision connectome data, we investigate different diffusion-reaction models to study the propagation of dynamic concentration patterns in control and lesioned connectomes. Therefore, differential equations for modeling diffusion were combined with well-known reaction terms to allow the use of connection weights, connectivity orientation and spatial distances. Three reaction-diffusion systems Gray-Scott, Gierer-Meinhardt and Mimura-Murray were investigated. For this purpose, implicit solvers were implemented in a numerically stable reaction-diffusion system within the framework of neuroVIISAS. The implemented reaction-diffusion systems were applied to a subconnectome which shapes the mechanosensitive pathway that is strongly affected in the multiple sclerosis demyelination disease. It was found that demyelination modeling by connectivity weight modulation changes the oscillations of the target region, i.e. the primary somatosensory cortex, of the mechanosensitive pathway.

In this article, we have described the development, implementation, and evaluation phases of establishing the AuSDaT. In the development phase, a governance structure with representatives from different data collection programs was established. Harmonisation of data variables, drawn from six programs used in hospitals for monitoring stroke care, was facilitated through creating a National Stroke Data Dictionary. The implementation phase involved a staged deployment for two national programs over 12&#160;months. The evaluation included an online survey of people who had used the AuSDaT between March 2018 and May 2018. By July 2016, data entered for an individual patient was, for the first time, shared between national programs. Overall, 119/422 users (90% female, 61% aged 30-49&#160;years, 57% nurses) completed the online evaluation survey. The two most positive features reported about the AuSDaT were (i) accessibility of the system (including simultaneous user access), and (ii) the ability to download reports to benchmark local data against peer hospitals or national performance. More than three quarters of respondents (n = 92, 77%) reported overall satisfaction with the data collection tool. The AuSDaT reduces duplication and enables users from different national programs for stroke to enter standardised data into a single system. This example may assist others who seek to establish a harmonised data management solution for different disease areas where multiple programs of data collection exist. The importance of undertaking continuous evaluation of end-users to identify preferences and aspects of the tool that are not meeting current requirements were illustrated.

We report that 1) Electron microscopy analysis confirms previous observations that glial cell nucleus present in sensory nerve, proliferate and migrate to axon tubes, where they form close contacts with surviving axons; 2) after peripheral axotomy performed in vivo on Coxo-Basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO), the sensory nerve does not convey any sensory message, but antidromic volleys are observed; 3) Central synaptic transmission from the CBCO to motoneurons (MNs) progressively declines over #200 days (90% of monosynaptic excitatory transmission is lost after 3 weeks, whereas 60% of disynaptic inhibitory transmission persist up to 6 months). After #200 days, no transmission is observed anymore; 4) However, this total loss is apparent only because repetitive electrical stimulation of the sensory nerve in vitro progressively restores first inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) then excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs); 5) The loss of synaptic transmission can be prevented by in vivo chronic sensory nerve stimulation; 6) Using simulations based on the geometric arrangements of synapses of the monosynaptic excitatory transmission and disynaptic inhibitory pathways, we show that antidromic activity in CBCO nerve could play a role in the maintenance of synaptic function of inhibitory pathways to MNs, but not on monosynaptic excitatory transmission to MNs. Taken together, our study confirms the deep changes in glial nucleus observed in axons deprived of their nucleus (already described by other authors, Bittner & Baxter, 1991; Parnas et al.,1998).

I argue that we should therefore study attention with broadly the same methodology that David Marr has applied to the study of perception. By focusing more on Marr's Computational Level of analysis, we arrive at a unified answer to the question of what attention is, what role it plays in the mind, and why organisms like us have that capacity. I propose a methodology for studying attention at Marr's Computational Level that optimizes in a three-dimensional space: it should capture core aspects of our first-person experience of attention, be explanatorily powerful in psychology and neuroscience, and fertile in an interdisciplinary context. I show how this methodology leads to what I call the priority structure account of attention. Attention is what organizes current information to make it more useful for the organism. We can identify it by four features. Attention, in this way, helps a cognitive system to integrate its informational state with its current motivational state.

The Drosophila melanogaster larva is a tractable model system for studying the circuit basis of behaviour, but many forms of associative learning have not yet been demonstrated in this animal.

Both stimuli are controlled in either open- or closed-loop, and delivered with high temporal and spatial precision. Using this tracker, we show for the first time that Drosophila larvae can perform classical conditioning with no overlap between sensory stimuli (i. e. trace conditioning). We also demonstrate that larvae are capable of operant conditioning by inducing a bend direction preference through optogenetic activation of reward-encoding serotonergic neurons.

However, it is unknown whether the protective effects of adropin are observed in aged animals following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. We hypothesized that adropin provides neuroprotection in aged mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Blood-brain barrier damage, tight junction proteins, and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) were assessed 48 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion by ELISA and Western blots. Genetic deletion of Enho significantly increased infarct volume and worsened neurological function, whereas overexpression of adropin dramatically reduced stroke volume compared to wild-type controls. Postischemic treatment with synthetic adropin peptide given at the onset of reperfusion markedly reduced infarct volume, brain edema, and significantly improved locomotor function and muscular strength at 48 hours. Delayed adropin treatment (4 hours after the stroke onset) reduced body weight loss, infarct volume, and muscular strength dysfunction, and improved long-term cognitive function. Postischemic adropin treatment significantly reduced blood-brain barrier damage. This effect was associated with reduced MMP-9 and preservation of tight junction proteins by adropin treatment.

Our results revealed that systemic administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs attenuates neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and ameliorated neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Three months following intravenous administration of DPSCs/BM-MSCs, we observed a negligible number of engrafted cells in the corpus callosum, sub-granular zone, and sub-ventricular zone. Thus, it is evident that functional recovery is still achievable despite poor engraftment of MSCs into CNS following systemic administration.", "query": "no_model"}, "36305148": {"ArticleTitle": "Ellagic acid prevents oxidative stress and memory deficits in a rat model of scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "Background Ellagic acid (EA) has various pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. Objective This study aimed to investigate the effects EA on learning and memory dysfunction as well as oxidative stress in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Methods The studied rats were treated according to the following protocol: Control (group 1) and scopolamine (group 2) groups received saline (intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) while the treatment groups (group 3-5) were given EA (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 weeks. Thereafter, their behavioral performance was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tasks. Notably, scopolamine was injected (into groups II-V at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.p.) before conducting the tasks. Finally, the oxidative stress indicators in the brain were measured. Results EA reduced the escape latencies and distances during learning phase of MWM. The results of probe trials also indicated that EA improved memory retrieval and helped the animals recall the platform. Moreover, EA increased delay and light time, while decreasing the frequency of entries to the dark area of PA. In the EA-treated groups, the level of malondialdehyde was decreased, while the levels of total thiol groups, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were increased. Conclusion EA prevented the negative effects of scopolamine on learning and memory which is probably mediated via modulating oxidative stress. Hence, EA could be considered as a potential alternative therapy in dementia.", "query": "no_model"}, "36305138": {"ArticleTitle": "Sex Differences in Serum Prolactin Levels in Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.", "AbstractText": "Serum prolactin levels are influenced by sex, physical development and medications among other factors.

These kinematic changes appeared as a direct consequence of learning, emerging even in absence of an actual threat to body integrity, as no shock occurred during reaching. Additionally, they correlated with the strength of sympathetic response during threat learning, establishing a direct relationship between previous learning and subsequent changes in action.

Furthermore, we observed that the changes in the accuracy of VC trials positively predicted the changes in PEA and that the two groups were classified according to the changes in PEA with a 61.3% accuracy.

Little is known about how individuals with narcissistic traits can improve their attitudes toward themselves and others. The current research puts self- and other compassion forward as possible targets to alleviate some of destructive patterns of narcissism. Generally, self-compassion (SC) has previously been associated with beneficial effects on psychological wellbeing, while other compassion (OC) is advantageous for interpersonal relationships. This study explored the relationship between narcissistic traits and the efficacy of experimental compassion inductions. Student and community participants (N = 230, M age  = 27.41, 65.2% female) completed grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic trait, SC and OC state questionnaires, and either an SC or OC induction. It was expected that individuals with higher narcissistic traits (particularly grandiose traits) would benefit from the inductions and show higher SC after but would have greater difficulty showing meaningful increases in OC (especially OC directed at the general population). The results indicated that individual differences in grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits are related to the magnitude of improvements following the inductions: the theorized lack of SC in individuals with vulnerable oversensitivity to judgment traits seems possible to be counteracted through different types of compassion exercises. Moreover, higher grandiose exploitativeness-entitlement and global vulnerable narcissistic traits related to less increases than others. However, directly inducing OC in individuals with these traits was linked to greater OC improvements than improvements after inducing SC.

Upon injury of a novel circuit which enabled fine control, the ancient circuits can sometimes take over its function for recovery; however, the recovered function is limited according to the capacity of the ancient circuits. In this review, we discuss two examples of functional recovery after neural injury in nonhuman primate models. The first is the recovery of dexterous hand movements following damage to the corticospinal tract. The second is the recovery of visual function after injury to the primary visual cortex (V1). In the former case, the functions of the direct cortico-motoneuronal pathway, which specifically developed in higher primates for the control of fractionated digit movements, can be partly compensated for by other descending motor pathways mediated by rubrospinal, reticulospinal, and propriospinal neurons. However, the extent of recovery depends on the location of the damage and which motor systems take over its function. In the latter case, after damage to V1, which is highly developed in primates, either the direct pathway from the lateral geniculate nucleus to extrastriate visual cortices or that from the midbrain superior colliculus-pulvinar-extrastriate/parietal cortices partly takes over the function of V1.

Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from five SSc patients and five healthy donors. Cells were cultured in medium with/without TGF-&#946;1 and with/without ALK5, pan-PIM or ATM kinase inhibitors. Extracellular flux analyses were performed to evaluate glycolytic and mitochondrial respiratory function. The mitochondrial network in TMRM-stained cells was visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy, followed by semi-automatic analysis on the ImageJ platform. Protein expression of ECM and fibroblast components, glycolytic enzymes, subunits of the five OXPHOS complexes, and dynamin-related GTPases and receptors involved in mitochondrial fission/fusion were assessed by western blotting. Enhanced mitochondrial respiration coupled to ATP production was observed in SSc fibroblasts at the expense of spare respiratory capacity. Although no difference was found in glycolysis when comparing SSc with healthy control fibroblasts, levels of phophofructokinase-1 isoform PFKM were significantly lower in SSc fibroblasts (P<0.05). Our results suggest that the number of respirasomes is decreased in the SSc mitochondria; however, the organelles formed a hyperfused network, which is thought to increase mitochondrial ATP production through complementation.

Despite the critical health importance of subcortical brain regions, there has been a dearth of research on their neurovascular responses. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) experiments can help fill this gap in our understanding. The BOLD hemodynamic response function (HRF) evoked by brief (<4 s) neural activation is crucial for the interpretation of fMRI results because linear analysis between neural activity and the BOLD response relies on the HRF. Moreover, the HRF is a consequence of underlying local blood flow and oxygen metabolism, so characterization of the HRF enables understanding of neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling. We measured the subcortical HRF at 9.4T and 3T with high spatiotemporal resolution using protocols that enabled reliable delineation of HRFs in individual subjects. These results were compared with the HRF in visual cortex. The HRF was faster in subcortical regions than cortical regions at both field strengths.

As pathological hallmarks are known to appear in 6-month-old animals, we expected to see disease-like changes in the 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice only after hormone depletion. Three-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were compared with their age-matched controls. As a menopause model, ovaries were removed (OVX or Sham surgery). After 1-month recovery, the body composition of the animals was measured by an MRI scan. The cognitive and anxiety parameters were evaluated by different behavioral tests, modeling different aspects (Y-maze, Morris water maze, open-field, social discrimination, elevated plus maze, light-dark box, fox odor, operant conditioning, and conditioned fear test). At the end of the experiment, uterus was collected, amyloid-&#946; accumulation, and the cholinergic system in the brain was examined by immunohistochemistry. The uterus weight decreased, and the body weight increased significantly in the OVX animals. The MRI data showed that the body weight change can be due to fat accumulation. Moreover, OVX increased anxiety in control, but decreased in 3xTg-AD animals, the later genotype being more anxious by default based on the anxiety z-score. In general, 3xTg-AD mice moved less. In relation to cognition, neither the 3xTg-AD genotype nor OVX surgery impaired learning and memory in general.

The extracellular matrix protein fibulin-3/EFEMP1 accumulates in the pleural effusions of MPM patients and has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker of these tumors. However, it is entirely unknown whether fibulin-3 plays a functional role on MPM growth and progression. Here, we demonstrate that fibulin-3 is upregulated in MPM tissue, promotes the malignant behavior of MPM cells, and can be targeted to reduce tumor progression. Overexpression of fibulin-3 increased the viability, clonogenic capacity and invasion of mesothelial cells, whereas fibulin-3 knockdown decreased these phenotypic traits as well as chemoresistance in MPM cells. At the molecular level, fibulin-3 activated PI3K/Akt signaling and increased the expression of a PI3K-dependent gene signature associated with cell adhesion, motility, and invasion. These pro-tumoral effects of fibulin-3 on MPM cells were disrupted by PI3K inhibition as well as by a novel, function-blocking, anti-fibulin-3 chimeric antibody. Anti-fibulin-3 antibody therapy tested in two orthotopic models of MPM inhibited fibulin-3 signaling, resulting in decreased tumor cell proliferation, reduced tumor growth, and extended animal survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that fibulin-3 is not only a prognostic factor of MPM but also a relevant molecular target in these tumors.

While optimizing the visualization and interaction process in VR remains an active topic, one of the most pressing issue is how to utilize VR for annotation and analysis of data.

Furthermore, whether highly noisy data comes from single-molecule recordings or segmented medical data, the necessity to guide analysis with user intervention creates both an ergonomic challenge to facilitate this interaction and a computational challenge to provide fluid interactions as information is being processed. Several applications, including our software DIVA for image stack and our platform Genuage for point clouds, have leveraged Virtual Reality (VR) to visualize and interact with data in 3D. While the visualization aspects can be made compatible with different types of data, quantifications, on the other hand, are far from being standard.

Although aging is well known to increase cancer initiation, the extent to which the mechanisms supporting GSC tumorigenicity are related to physiological aging remains unknown. Here, we investigate the transcriptional mechanisms by which Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3), a transcriptional regulator that promotes healthy aging, affects GSC function and the extent to which FOXO3 transcriptional networks are dysregulated in aging and GBM. We performed transcriptome analysis of clinical GBM tumors and observed that high FOXO3 activity is associated with gene expression signatures of stem cell quiescence, reduced oxidative metabolism, and improved patient outcomes. Consistent with these findings, we show that elevated FOXO3 activity significantly reduces the proliferation of GBM-derived GSCs. Using RNA-seq, we find that functional ablation of FOXO3 in GSCs rewires the transcriptional circuitry associated with metabolism, epigenetic stability, quiescence, and differentiation. Since FOXO3 has been implicated in healthy aging, we then investigated the extent to which it regulates common transcriptional programs in aging neural stem cells (NSCs) and GSCs. We uncover a shared transcriptional program and, most strikingly, find that FOXO3-regulated pathways are associated with altered mitochondrial functions in both aging and GBM.

The cohort consisted of 823 patients who met inclusion criteria, and 56 patients (6.8%) had recurrence on imaging follow-up. The median age of the cohort was 56 years, and 77.4% of patients were female. The median duration of head imaging follow-up for the entire cohort was 2.7 years, but for the subgroup of patients who had a recurrence, the median follow-up was 10.1 years. Estimated 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrence-free survival rates were 99.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.8%-99.9%), 91.0% (95% CI 87.7%-93.6%), 83.6% (95% CI 78.6%-87.6%), and 77.3% (95% CI 69.7%-83.4%), respectively, for the entire cohort. On multivariate analysis, MIB-1 index (odds ratio [OR] per 1% increase: 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.58, p = 0.0003) and follow-up duration (OR per year: 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21, p = 0.012) were both associated with recurrence. Gradient-boosted decision tree and random forest analyses both identified MIB-1 index as the main factor associated with recurrence, aside from length of imaging follow-up. For tumors with an MIB-1 index < 8, recurrences were documented up to 8 years after surgery. For tumors with an MIB-1 index &#8805; 8, recurrences were documented up to 12 years following surgery. Long-term imaging follow-up is important even after a complete resection of a meningioma. Higher MIB-1 labeling index is associated with greater risk of recurrence. Imaging screening for at least 8 years in patients with an MIB-1 index < 8 and at least 12 years for those with an MIB-1 index &#8805; 8 may be needed to detect long-term recurrences.", "query": "no_model"}, "36303441": {"ArticleTitle": "PVH-Peri5 Pathway for Stress-Coping Oromotor and Anxious Behaviors in Mice.", "AbstractText": "Stressful stimuli can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Clinically, it has been widely reported that stressful events are often accompanied by teeth clenching and bruxism, while mastication (chewing) can promote coping with stress. Trigeminal motoneurons in the trigeminal motor nucleus supplying the chewing muscles receive direct inputs from interneurons within the peritrigeminal premotor area (Peri5). Previous studies found that the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) participates in trigeminal activities during stressful events. However, the neural pathway by which the stress-induced oral movements alleviate stress is largely unknown. We hypothesized that paraventricular-trigeminal circuits might be associated with the stress-induced chewing movements and anxiety levels. First, we observed the stress-coping effect of wood gnawing on stress-induced anxiety, with less anxiety-like behaviors seen in the open field test and elevated plus maze, as well as decreased corticosterone and blood glucose levels, in response to stress in mice. We then found that excitotoxic lesions of PVH reduced the effect of gnawing on stress, reflected in more anxiety-like behaviors; this emphasizes the importance of the PVH in stress responses. Anterograde, retrograde, transsynaptic, and nontranssynaptic tracing through central and peripheral injections confirmed monosynaptic projections from PVH to Peri5. We discovered that PVH receives proprioceptive sensory inputs from the jaw muscle and periodontal ligaments, as well as provides motor outputs via the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Me5) and Peri5. Next, pathway-specific functional manipulation by chemogenetic inhibition was conducted to further explore the role of PVH-Peri5 monosynaptic projections. Remarkably, PVH-Peri5 inhibition decreased gnawing but did not necessarily reduce stress-induced anxiety. Moreover, neuropeptide B (NPB) was expressed in Peri5-projecting PVH neurons, indicating that NPB signaling may mediate the effects of PVH-Peri5. In conclusion, our data revealed a PVH-Peri5 circuit that plays a role in the stress response via its associations with oromotor movements and relative anxiety-like behaviors.", "query": "no_model"}, "36303432": {"ArticleTitle": "Recurrence of symptoms following cryptococcal meningitis - characterizing a diagnostic conundrum with multiple etiologies.", "AbstractText": "Cryptococcal meningitis is a common cause of AIDS-related mortality.

The extent of tissue damage is frequently severe, often leading to loss of visual function, and there is no curative treatment for this condition. To develop a novel therapeutic strategy, elucidating the underlying pathological mechanism using a clinically relevant experimental ON model is necessary. However, previous ON animal models have only resulted in mild lesions with limited functional impairment. In the present study, we attempted to establish a feasible ON model with severe pathological and functional manifestations using a high-affinity anti-AQP4 antibody. Subsequently, we aimed to address whether our model is suitable for potential drug evaluation by testing the effect of minocycline, a well-known microglia/macrophage inhibitor. AQP4-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-related ON in rats was induced by direct injection of a high-affinity anti-AQP4 monoclonal antibody, E5415A. Thereafter, the pathological and functional characterizations were performed, and the therapeutic potential of minocycline was investigated. We established an experimental ON model that reproduces the histological characteristics of ON in seropositive NMO, such as loss of AQP4/glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity, immune cell infiltration, and extensive axonal damage. We also observed that our rat model exhibited severe visual dysfunction. The histological analysis showed prominent accumulation of macrophages/activated microglia in the lesion site in the acute phase. Thus, we investigated the possible effect of the pharmacological inhibition of macrophages/microglia activation by minocycline and revealed that it effectively ameliorated axonal damage and functional outcome. We established an AQP4-IgG-induced ON rat model with severe functional impairments that reproduce the histological characteristics of patients with NMO.

The combination of distinct speech patterns via objective acoustic evaluation was able to discriminate between PSP and MSA with very high accuracy of up to 89% as well as between PSP/MSA and PD with up to 87%. Dysarthria severity in MSA/PSP was related to overall disease severity. Speech disorders reflect the differing underlying pathophysiology of tauopathy in PSP and &#945;-synucleinopathy in MSA.

Across regions, we found differential expression of immune-related transcripts and a substantial loss of rhythmicity in core circadian clock genes in subjects with psychosis. In the nucleus accumbens, mitochondrial-related transcripts had decreased expression in subjects with psychosis, but only in those who died at night. Additionally, we found a loss of rhythmicity in small nucleolar RNAs and a gain of rhythmicity in glutamatergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens of subjects with psychosis. Between-region comparisons indicated that rhythmicity in the caudate and putamen was far more similar in subjects with psychosis than in matched comparison subjects.

Neuronal death leads to release of tau proteins which can become dephosphorylated, rephosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated in the setting of ischemia, possibly leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, a potential synergistic effect between development of tauopathy and cerebrovascular lesion burden may contribute to cognitive decline after stroke. We explored the spatial and temporal distribution of neurofibrillary tangles after ischemic stroke in vivo by using 18F-MK-6240 positron emission tomography (PET). We included patients with a first ischemic stroke to undergo longitudinal 18F-MK-6240 PET/MR within 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months after stroke. For cross-sectional analyses, we also included age-matched healthy controls. We delineated 5 volumes-of-interest based on T2 FLAIR and T1 MR data: the ischemic lesion, 3 consecutive peri-ischemic areas and the remaining ipsilesional hemisphere. We performed region-based voxel-wise partial volume correction on the PET data and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with the cerebellum as reference region. We did not quantify PET scans of patients within the first month after stroke (n = 17; median age 73 years [IQR: 62-82]) since the signal intensity was influenced by blood brain barrier breakdown hampering a reliable data analysis. At 6 months after the event (n = 13; median age 71 years [IQR: 60-79]), 18F-MK-6240 SUVR was increased in the ischemic lesion compared to 20 age-matched healthy controls (median age 71.5 years [IQR: 66-76]; ratiolesion/controls = 1.62&#177;0.54; one-sample t-test: p = 0.0015) and gradually decreased in the surrounding tissue (one-way within-subject ANOVA(F(1.2, 14.8) = 18.0, p = 0.00043).

HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D questionnaire at 90 days, comprising the EQ-5D index and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We calculated the effect of treatment on EQ-5D index and EQ VAS using multiple linear regression models.

Among 490 stroke survivors, the EQ-5D index was available for 452 (92.2%), of whom 226 (50%) were assigned to treatment with alteplase and 226 (50%) to placebo.

Our hypothesis built on prior observations of twofold symmetry in the directional tuning curves of rats in a globally twofold-symmetric environment. To test whether environment symmetry was the relevant factor shaping the directional responses, here we deployed the same apparatus (two connected rectangular boxes) plus one with fourfold symmetry (a 2x2 array of connected square boxes) and one with onefold symmetry (a circular open-field arena). Consistent with our hypothesis we found many neurons with tuning curve symmetries that mirrored these environment symmetries, having twofold, fourfold or onefold-symmetric tuning respectively. Some cells expressed this pattern only globally (across the whole environment), maintaining singular tuning curves in each subcompartment. However, others also expressed it locally, within each subcompartment. Since multidirectionality has not been reported in na&#239;ve rats in single environmental compartments, this suggests an experience-dependent effect of global environment symmetry on local firing symmetry. An intermingled population of directional neurons were \"classic\" head direction cells, with globally referenced directional tuning: these cells were electrophysiologically distinct, with narrower tuning curves and a burstier firing pattern. Thus, retrosplenial directional neurons can simultaneously encode overall head direction and local head direction (relative to compartment layout).

Living organisms have a limited capacity to consume energy. Overconsumption of energy by allostatic brain-body processes leads to hypermetabolism, defined as excess energy expenditure above the organism's optimum. In turn, hypermetabolism accelerates physiological decline in cells, laboratory animals, and humans, and may drive biological aging. Therefore, we propose that the transition from adaptive allostasis to maladaptive allostatic states, allostatic load, and allostatic overload arises when the added energetic cost of stress competes with longevity-promoting growth, maintenance, and repair. Mechanistically, the energetic restriction of growth, maintenance and repair processes leads to the progressive wear-and-tear of molecular and organ systems.

This newfound ability to investigate individual cells opens new avenues to understand viral pathophysiology with unprecedented resolution. To leverage this ability, we propose an efficient and accurate computational pipeline, named Venus, for virus detection and integration site discovery in both single-cell and bulk-tissue RNA-seq data. Specifically, Venus addresses two main questions: whether a tissue/cell type is infected by viruses or a virus of interest? And if infected, whether and where has the virus inserted itself into the human genome? Our analysis can be broken into two parts-validation and discovery. Firstly, for validation, we applied Venus on well-studied viral datasets, such as HBV- hepatocellular carcinoma and HIV-infection treated with antiretroviral therapy. Secondly, for discovery, we analyzed datasets such as HIV-infected neurological patients and deeply sequenced T-cells. We detected viral transcripts in the novel target of the brain and high-confidence integration sites in immune cells.

Here, we tested the above hypothesis using direct measurements of the partial pressure of O2 (pO2) in cortical tissue by means of 2-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). We revisited our previously developed method for extraction of the cerebral metabolic rate of O2 (CMRO2) based on 2-photon pO2 measurements around diving arterioles and applied this method to estimate baseline CMRO2 in awake mice across cortical layers. To our surprise, our results revealed a decrease in baseline CMRO2 from layer I to layer IV. This decrease of CMRO2 with cortical depth was paralleled by an increase in tissue oxygenation. Higher baseline oxygenation and cytochrome density in layer IV may serve as an O2 reserve during surges of neuronal activity or certain metabolically active brain states rather than reflecting baseline energy needs.

In the present study, we investigated whether reading expertise determines the strength of the space-time congruency effect, which would suggest that learning to read and write drives the effect. Using a temporal categorization task, we compared two types of space-time congruency effects, one where spatial incongruency was generated by the location of the stimuli on the screen and one where it was generated by the location of the responses on the keyboard. While the first type of incongruency was visuo-spatial only, the second involved the motor system. Results showed stronger space-time congruency effects for the second type of incongruency (i.e., when the motor system was involved) than for the first type (visuo-spatial). Crucially, reading expertise, as measured by a standardized reading test, predicted the size of the space-time congruency effects.

Notably, Edis depleted flies display heightened resistance to bacterial infection and enhanced pathogen clearance. Conversely, ectopic Edis expression blocks innate immunity signaling. In addition, inactivation of Edis in vivo leads to impaired locomotor activity and shortened lifespan. Remarkably, these phenotypes can be recapitulated with neuron-specific depletion of Edis, accompanied by defective neurodevelopment. Furthermore, inactivation of Relish suppresses the innate immunity hyperactivation phenotype in the fly brain. Moreover, we provide evidence that Edis encodes a functional protein that associates with and compromises the processing and activation of the immune transcription factor Relish. Importantly, restoring Edis expression or ectopic expression of Edis-encoded protein suppresses both innate immunity and neurodevelopment phenotypes elicited by Edis depletion.

Failure to report sex could lead to inappropriate generalisations of research findings, and less effective translation into clinical practice. Preclinical sex bias (preferential selection of one sex) is present across other fields including neuroscience and immunology but remains uninvestigated in skeletal research. For context we firstly summarised key literature describing sexually dimorphic bone phenotypes in mice. We then investigated sex reporting practices in skeletal research, specifically how customary it is for murine sex to be included journal article titles or abstracts and then determined whether any bias in sex reporting exists. Since sex hormones are important regulators of bone health, gonadectomy procedures i.e. ovariectomy (OVX) and orchidectomy (ORX) are common yet typically not reported with sex, we incorporated reporting of OVX and ORX terms, representing female and male mice respectively, into our investigations around sex bias. Between 1999 and 2020, inclusion of sex in titles or abstracts was low in murine skeletal studies (2.6%-4.06%). Reporting of OVX and ORX terms was low (1.44%-2.64%) and reporting of OVX and ORX with sex uncommon (0.4%-0.3%). When studies were combined to include both sexes and OVX (representing female) and ORX terms (representing male), a bias towards reporting of female mice was evident. However, when the terms OVX and ORX were removed, a bias towards the use of male mice was identified. Thus studies focussing on sex hormones are biased towards female reporting with all other studies biased in reporting of male mice. We now call upon journal editors to introduce consistent guidance for transparent and accessible reporting of murine sex in skeletal research, to better monitor preclinical sex bias, to diversify development of treatments for bone health, and to enable global skeletal health equity.

However, the effects of early stress on natural rewards, such as food and social rewards, which have strong implications for symptoms of psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD), are understudied. To fill this gap, we used the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) procedure to assess the impact of early resource scarcity on motivational drive for both food and social rewards in rats. Male and female Long Evans rats were reared in either an LBN environment, with limited nesting materials and no enrichment, from their postnatal day 2-9 or control environment with ample nesting materials and enrichment. As adults, they were tested for reward-seeking behavior on progressive ratio operant tasks: food reward (sucrose) or social reward (access to a same-sex/age conspecific). We observed sex differences in the impact of LBN on motivation for natural rewards. In males, LBN increased motivation for both a sucrose and social reward. In females, LBN reduced motivation for sucrose but had no effect on social reward. These results suggest that the effects of LBN on motivation for natural rewards are both sex- and reinforcer-dependent, with males and females showing differential motivation for food and social rewards following early scarcity.

We recently found, rather unexpectedly, that choice of the nondrug alternative is in fact inflexible and habitual. One possible contributing factor to habitual choice is the intermittency and uncontrollability of choice trials in previous studies. Here, we asked whether and to what extent volitional control over the occurrence of choice trials could change animals' preference by preventing habitual choice. To do so, rats were trained to nosepoke in a hole to trigger the presentation of two operant levers: one associated with cocaine, the other with saccharin. Rats were then free to choose among the two levers to obtain the corresponding reward, after which both levers retracted until rats self-initiated the next choice trial. Overall, we found that volitional control over choice trials did not change preference. Most rats preferred saccharin over cocaine and selected this option almost exclusively. Intriguingly, after repeated choice and consumption of saccharin, rats transiently lost interest in this option (i.e., due to sensory-specific satiety), but they did not switch to cocaine, preferring instead to pause during long periods of time before reinitiating a choice trial for saccharin. This finding suggests that during volitional initiation of a choice trial, rats fail to consider cocaine as an option.

In rats, cue-induced craving progressively intensifies ('incubates') during withdrawal from extended-access self-administration of several classes of misused drugs, including the psychostimulants cocaine and methamphetamine. For these psychostimulants, incubation is associated with strengthening of excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) through incorporation of &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are therefore Ca2+ -permeable (CP-AMPARs). Once CP-AMPAR upregulation occurs, their stimulation is required for expression of incubation. It is not known if a similar mechanism contributes to incubation of oxycodone craving. Using male rats, we established that incubation occurs by withdrawal day (WD) 15 and persists through WD30. Then, using cell-surface biotinylation, we found that surface levels of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 but not GluA2 are elevated in NAc core and shell of oxycodone rats on WD15, although this wanes by WD30. Next, using intra-NAc injection of the selective CP-AMPAR antagonist Naspm before a seeking test, we demonstrate that CP-AMPAR blockade in either subregion decreases oxycodone seeking on WD15 or WD30 (after incubation), but not WD1, and has no effect in saline self-administering animals. The Naspm results suggest CP-AMPARs persist in synapses through WD30 even if total cell surface levels wane.

Methods: 793 patients (67% women) consecutively presenting with NSSI (17%) or SA (83%) at 3 Swedish hospitals took part in face-to-face interviews. Past and current self-harm was characterized by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Clinical records and national register data were employed to determine 1-year outcomes.

Evidence Review: PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to July 2021 for English-language articles describing concomitant use of ketamine and MAOIs. The search strategy included terms for \"ketamine\" AND \"monoamine oxidase inhibitor\" including generic and brand names. Additionally, we describe the safety of twice weekly oral esketamine administration over the course of 5 weeks to 9 months in 8 TRD patients using MAOIs. Findings: After deduplication, we screened 138 articles and assessed 43 full texts. Twelve studies were included with a total of 39 patients receiving ketamine and MAOIs. Blood pressure and heart rate increased in multiple cases, though this was deemed clinically insignificant in all but 1 patient. No signs of hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome were observed. In our case series, we observed minor elevations in blood pressure and heart rate and no serious adverse events.

The mechanisms by which IBs facilitate efficient viral replication remain largely unknown but may involve an intricate network of regulation at the host-virus interface. Viruses are able to modulate such interactions by a variety of strategies including adaptation of their genomes and \"hijacking\" of host proteins. The latter possibility broadens the molecular reservoir available for a virus to enhance its replication and/or antagonize host antiviral responses. Here, we show that the cellular 5'-3' exoribonuclease, XRN1, is a host protein hijacked by MeV. We found that upon MeV infection, XRN1 is translocated to cytoplasmic IBs where it acts in a proviral manner by preventing the accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within the IBs. This leads to the suppression of the dsRNA-induced innate immune responses mediated via the protein kinase R (PKR)-integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. IMPORTANCE Measles virus remains a major global health threat due to its high transmissibility and significant morbidity in children and immunocompromised individuals. Although there is an effective vaccine against MeV, a large population in the world remains without access to the vaccine, contributing to more than 7,000,000 measles cases and 60,000 measles deaths in 2020 (CDC). For negative-sense RNA viruses including MeV, one active research area is the exploration of virus-host interactions occurring at cytoplasmic IBs where viral replication takes place. In this study we present evidence suggesting a model in which MeV IBs antagonize host innate immunity by recruiting XRN1 to reduce dsRNA accumulation and subsequent PKR kinase activation/ISR induction. In the absence of XRN1, the increased dsRNA level acts as a potent activator of the antiviral PKR/ISR pathway leading to suppression of global cap-dependent mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication.", "query": "no_model"}, "36300918": {"ArticleTitle": "Analyzing the brainstem circuits for respiratory chemosensitivity in freely moving mice.", "AbstractText": "Regulation of systemic PCO2 is a life-preserving homeostatic mechanism.

While it is well-established that global YY1 knockout (KO) leads to embryonic death in mice and that YY1 deletion in neurons or oligodendrocytes induces impaired brain function, the role of astrocytic YY1 in the brain remains unknown. We investigated the role of astrocytic YY1 in the brain using a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-specific YY1 conditional KO (YY1 cKO) mouse model to delete astrocytic YY1. Astrocytic YY1 cKO mice were tested for behavioral phenotypes, such as locomotor activity, coordination, and cognition, followed by an assessment of relevant biological pathways using RNA-sequencing analysis, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry in the cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum. YY1 cKO mice showed abnormal phenotypes, movement deficits, and cognitive dysfunction. At the molecular level, astrocytic YY1 deletion altered the expression of genes associated with proliferation and differentiation, p53/caspase apoptotic pathways, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory signaling including NF-&#954;B, STAT, and IRF in all regions. Astrocytic YY1 deletion significantly increased the expression of GFAP as astrocytic activation and Iba1 as microglial activation, indicating astrocytic YY1 deletion activated microglia as well. Accordingly, multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including TNF-&#945; and CXCL10 were elevated. Combined, these novel findings suggest that astrocytic YY1 is a critical transcription factor for normal brain development and locomotor activity, motor coordination, and cognition.

In this cohort study, pathogenic variants associated with rare monogenic stroke were more common than expected in the general population and associated with stroke and dementia. Cardiovascular risk burden is associated with the penetrance of such variants.

Autosomal-dominant auditory neuropathy type 2 (AUNA2) was linked either to chromosomal bands 12q24 or 13q34 in a large German family in 2017. By whole genome sequencing, we now detected a 5500&#160;bp deletion in ATP11A on chromosome 13q34 segregating with the phenotype in this family. ATP11A encodes a P-type ATPase that translocates phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. The deletion affects both isoforms of ATP11A and activates a cryptic splice site leading to the formation of an alternative last exon. ATP11A carrying the altered C-terminus loses its flippase activity for phosphatidylserine. Atp11a is expressed in fibers and synaptic contacts of the auditory nerve and in the cochlear nucleus in mice and conditional Atp11a knockout mice show a progressive reduction of the spiral ganglion neuron compound action potential, recapitulating the human phenotype of auditory neuropathy.

We use connectotyping, which efficiently models functional brain connectivity to reveal the progression of temporal brain connectivity patterns in task fMRI.

All cardiac parameters except redundant FO membrane and PLSCV showed a significant correlation with CoA. Statistical analysis confirmed that cardiovascular disproportion with right predominance carries an increased risk for occurrence of CoA, especially if already evident during the ultrasound evaluation in the second trimester. Aortic valve (AV) z-score and distal transverse aortic arch (TAA) z-score resulted as the best predictors of CoA after birth.

The current criteria for diagnosing CoA in utero allow accurate diagnosis of most severe cases but the rate of false positives remains relatively high for milder cases. A combination of anatomic and functional echocardiographic parameters might be used in stratifying the risk of CoA.

Sixty-three PDCN and 43 controls underwent functional MRI while judging whether pictures, rotated at various angles, depicted the left or right hand. The task activates systems that respond to increases in rotation angle, a proxy for visuospatial difficulty. Angle-modulated functional connectivity was analyzed for frontal cortex, posterior cortex, and basal ganglia regions. Two aberrant connectivity patterns were found in PDCN, which were condensed into principal components that characterized the strength and topology of angle-modulated connectivity. One topology related to a marked failure to amplify frontal, posterior, and basal ganglia connectivity with other brain areas as visuospatial demands increased, unlike the control group (control features). Another topology related to functional reorganization whereby regional connectivity was strengthened with brain areas not recruited by the control group (PDCN features). Functional topologies correlated with diverse cognitive domains at baseline, underscoring their influences on spatial cognition. In PDCN, expression of topologies that were control features predicted greater cognitive progression longitudinally, suggesting inefficient communications within circuitry normally recruited to handle spatial demands. Conversely, stronger expression of topologies that were PDCN features predicted less longitudinal cognitive decline, suggesting functional reorganization was compensatory. Parieto-occipital topologies (control features) had different prognostic implications for longitudinal changes in motor disability. Expression of one topology predicted less motor decline, whereas expression of another predicted increased postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD) feature severity.

Such biased angular tuning has recently been shown in the mouse primary visual cortex. However, it is still unknown if mice also show a perceptual dominance of cardinal orientations. Here, we describe the design of a novel custom-built touchscreen chamber that allows testing natural scene perception and orientation discrimination performance by applying different task designs. Using this chamber, we applied an iterative convergence towards orientation discrimination thresholds for cardinal or oblique orientations in different cohorts of mice. Surprisingly, the expert discrimination performance was similar for both groups but showed large inter-individual differences in performance and training time. To study the discrimination of cardinal and oblique stimuli in the same mice, we, therefore, applied, a different training regime where mice learned to discriminate cardinal and oblique gratings in parallel. Parallel training revealed a higher task performance for cardinal orientations in an early phase of the training. The performance for both orientations became similar after prolonged training, suggesting that learning permits equally high perceptual tuning towards oblique stimuli. In summary, our custom-built touchscreen chamber offers a flexible tool to test natural visual perception in rodents and revealed a training-induced increase in the perception of oblique gratings.

CBA/CaJ mice were trained in an operant conditioning, active avoidance (AA) test, and a reflexive, gap-induced pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle (GPIAS) test, or both.

Tinnitus was assessed 8 weeks after sound overexposure. Most mice had evidence of tinnitus behavior in at least one of the two behaviors. Of the mice evaluated in AA, over half (55%) had tinnitus positive behavior. In GPIAS, fewer animals (13%) were positive than were identified using the AA test. Few mice were positive in both tests (10%), and only one was positive for tinnitus behavior at the same spectral frequency in both tests. When the association between tinnitus behavior and spontaneous activity recorded in the inferior colliculus was compared, animals with tinnitus behavior in AA exhibited increased spontaneous activity, while those positive in GPIAS did not.

Accumulating evidence indicates that these synergies emerge because of upregulation of diffusely projecting brainstem motor pathways following stroke-induced damage to corticofugal pathways. During our recent work on differences in synergy expression among proximal and distal joints, we serendipitously observed some notable characteristics of synergy-driven muscle activation. It seemed that: paretic wrist/finger muscles were activated maximally during contractions of muscles at a different joint; differences in the magnitude of synergy expression occurred when elicited via contraction of proximal vs. distal muscles; and associated reactions in the paretic limb occurred during maximal efforts with the non-paretic limb, the strength of which seemed to vary depending on which muscles in the non-paretic limb were contracting. Here we formally investigated these observations and interpreted them within the context of the neural mechanisms thought to underlie stereotypical movement patterns. If upregulation of brainstem motor pathways occurs following stroke-induced corticofugal tract damage, then we would expect a pattern of muscle dependency in the observed behaviors consistent with such neural reorganization. Twelve participants with moderate-to-severe hemiparetic stroke and six without stroke performed maximal isometric torque generation in eight directions: shoulder abduction/adduction and elbow, wrist, and finger flexion/extension. Isometric joint torques and surface EMG were recorded from shoulder, elbow, wrist, and finger joints and muscles. For some participants, joint torque and muscle activation generated during maximal voluntary contractions were lower than during maximal synergy-induced contractions (i.e., contractions about a different joint), particularly for wrist and fingers. Synergy-driven contractions were strongest when elicited via proximal joints and weakest when elicited via distal joints. Associated reactions in the wrist/finger flexors were stronger than those of other paretic muscles and were the only ones whose response depended on whether the non-paretic contraction was at a proximal or distal joint.

However, information on rehabilitation processes and outcomes is often lacking, and predictors of functional outcomes remain poorly explored. This paper describes a multicenter study protocol to implement a Stroke rehabilitation Registry, mainly based on a multidimensional assessment proposed by the Italian Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PMIC2020), in a pilot Italian cohort of stroke survivors undergoing post-acute inpatient rehabilitation, to provide a systematic assessment of processes and outcomes and develop data-driven prediction models of functional outcomes. All patients with a diagnosis of ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke confirmed by clinical assessment, admitted to intensive rehabilitation units within 30 days from the acute event, aged 18+, and providing informed consent will be enrolled. Measures will be taken at admission (T0), at discharge (T1), and at follow-up, 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after the stroke. Assessment variables include anamnestic data, clinical and nursing complexity information and measures of body structures and function, activity and participation (PMIC2020), rehabilitation interventions, adverse events and discharge data. The modified Barthel Index will be our primary outcome. In addition to classical biostatistical analysis, learning algorithms will be cross-validated to achieve data-driven prognosis prediction models. This study will test the feasibility of a stroke rehabilitation registry in the Italian health context and provide a systematic assessment of processes and outcomes for quality assessment and benchmarking.

In stroke survivors, the paretic muscles may develop hypertonia due to both neural-mediated mechanisms and structural alterations with consequent muscular fibrous-fatty remodeling. Fourteen adult patients with spastic dystonia following stroke were recruited. Muscle hypertonia was assessed using the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). Muscle activation was measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) with the selected muscle in shortened (spastic dystonia) and stretched (dynamic stretch reflex) positions. SWE was performed on a selected paretic muscle and on the contralateral non-paretic one to calculate shear wave velocities (SWV) along and across muscular fibers. The modified Heckmatt scale (MHS) pattern was also determined. All evaluations were performed shortly before BoNT-A injections (T0) and one month later (T1). All SWV on paretic muscles were higher than contralateral non-paretic ones (p < 0.01). After BoNT-A injection, a significant reduction in MAS (p = 0.0018), spastic dystonia (p = 0.0043), and longitudinal SWE measurements, both in shortened (p = 0.001) and in stretched muscular conditions (p = 0.0029), was observed. No significant changes in SWV on non-paretic muscles were observed. Higher SWV resulted along the direction of muscular fibers vs. across them (p = 0.001). No changes resulted from the MHS evaluations after BoNT-A. There was a positive correlation between MHS scores and SWV values while the muscle was in the shortened position, but not with spastic dystonia recorded by sEMG. This is the first study evaluating the effect of BoNT-A on muscle hypertonia following stroke, assessed by both SWE and sEMG. These findings support SWE as a useful method to disclose intrinsic muscular remodeling, independently of the effect of spastic dystonia, in particular, while muscles were assessed in a neutral position. SWE measurements of muscle stiffness cannot tell apart neural-mediated and intrinsic muscle hypertonia. Interestingly, when sEMG activity is very limited, as in spastic muscles kept in a shortened position, SWE can provide a measurement of stiffness due almost completely to intrinsic muscle changes. Alongside sEMG, SWE could aid clinicians in the assessment of responses to treatments.", "query": "no_model"}, "36299248": {"ArticleTitle": "MNK1/2 contributes to periorbital hypersensitivity and hyperalgesic priming in preclinical migraine models.", "AbstractText": "Migraine is thought to involve sensitization of the trigeminal nociceptive system.

Female and male wild-type (WT) and MNK1 knock-out (KO) mice were subjected to repeated restraint stress or a dural injection of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tested for periorbital hypersensitivity and grimacing. Upon returning to baseline thresholds, stressed mice were administered a low dose of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and mice previously injected with IL-6 were given a second dural injection of pH 7.0 to test for hyperalgesic priming. MNK1 KO mice were significantly less hypersensitive than WTs following dural IL-6 and did not prime to pH 7.0 or SNP. Furthermore, treatment with the selective MNK inhibitor, eFT508, in WT mice prevented hypersensitivity caused by dural IL-6 or pH 7.0.
